1
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,424
WOMAN:
Splendid.

2
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,926
VALET 1:
Sorry, sir, I've already got one there.

3
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,611
VALET 1:
Over here, sir, over here.

4
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,911
VALET 2:
Coming through.

5
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,584
VALET 1:
Over here, sir.

6
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,422
VALET 1:
Make way.

7
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,049
ELIZA:
Freddy, oh, it's already very late.

8
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,191
MAN:
Move it, darn it.

9
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,336
Freddy, go and find a cab.

10
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,629
Do you want me
to catch pneumonia?

11
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:08,765
MAN:
Watch out, daffy.

12
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,186
He calls me a daffy.

13
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,191
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

14
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,649
All right, I'll get it. I'll get it.

15
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,704
MAN:
I'm getting wet.

16
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,370
MAN:
I'm so sorry.

17
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,667
Look where you're going, dear.
Look where you're going.

18
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,249
I'm so sorry.

19
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,264
Two bunches of violets
trod in the mud.

20
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,256
A full day's wages.

21
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,588
EYNSFORD-HILL:
Freddy.

22
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,642
Freddy, go and find a cab.

23
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,466
Yes, Mother.

24
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,733
Oh, he's your son, is he?

25
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,185
Well, if you'd done your duty by him
as a mother should,

26
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,306
you wouldn't let him spoil
a poor girl's flowers

27
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,863
and then run away without paying.

28
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,935
Oh, go about your business, my girl.

29
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:03,072
And you wouldn't go off
without paying either.

30
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,990
Two bunches of violets
trod in the mud.

31
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,867
Good heavens.

32
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,369
- Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?
- I'm afraid not.

33
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,121
- It's worse than before.
- Oh, dear.

34
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,793
If it's worse,
it's a sign it's nearly over.

35
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,632
Cheer up, captain.
Buy a flower off a poor girl.

36
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,128
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

37
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,800
Oh, I can change half a crown.
Here, take this for tuppence.

38
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,639
I told you, I'm awfully sorry,
I haven't--

39
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,264
Oh, wait a minute. Oh, yes.

40
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,641
Here's three ha'pence,
if that's any use to you.

41
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,768
Thank you, sir.

42
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,481
Here, you be careful.
Better give him a flower for it.

43
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,403
There is a bloke here
behind that pillar

44
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,862
taking down every blessed word
you're saying.

45
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,503
I ain't done nothing wrong
by speaking to the gentleman.

46
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,374
I've a right to sell flowers
if I keep off the curb.

47
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,672
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

48
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,916
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flower off me.

49
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,800
MAN 1: Don't start.
- What's all the noise?

50
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,256
There's a tec taking her down.

51
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,796
I'm making an honest living.

52
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,219
MAN 2:
Who's doing all that shouting?

53
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,468
- Where is it coming from?
ELIZA: Well...

54
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,890
Oh, sir, don't let him charge me.
They don't know what it means to me.

55
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,560
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets

56
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,189
for speaking to gentlemen.

57
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,056
There, there, there.

58
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,653
Who's hurting you, you silly girl?
What you take me for?

59
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,649
On my Bible oath,
I never spoke a word.

60
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,361
Shut up. Do I look like a policeman?

61
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,201
Then what did you take down
me words for?

62
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,866
How do I know
you took me down right?

63
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,994
You just show me
what you wrote about me.

64
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,749
ELIZA:
Oh.

65
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,749
What's that?
That ain't proper writing.

66
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,501
- I can't read it.
- I can.

67
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:47,933
"I say, captain,
now buy a flower off a poor girl."

68
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:53,102
Oh, it's because
I called him "captain."

69
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,347
Oh, I meant no harm.

70
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,188
Sir, don't let him lay a charge
against me for a word like that.

71
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,854
I'll make no charge.

72
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,862
Really, sir, if you are a detective,
you needn't begin protecting me

73
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,815
against molestation
from young women until I ask you.

74
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,567
Anyone could tell the girl
meant no harm.

75
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,359
He ain't no tec.
He's a gentleman.

76
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,623
Look at his boots.

77
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,664
How are all your people
down at Selsey?

78
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,198
Who told you
my people come from Selsey?

79
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,412
Never mind. They do.

80
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,213
How do you come to be
up so far east?

81
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,286
You were born in Lisson Grove.

82
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:26,013
Oh, what harm is there my leaving
Lisson Grove?

83
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,125
It weren't fit for a pig to live in
and I had to pay 4 and 6 a week--

84
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,973
Live where you like,
but stop that noise.

85
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,558
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

86
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,925
- I'm a good girl, I am.
- Yes, yes, yes.

87
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,642
Where do I come from?

88
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,892
Hoxton.

89
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,563
Well, who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

90
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,863
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

91
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,528
I don't know whether you've noticed,
but it's stopped raining.

92
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,817
You can get a motor bus
to Hampton Court.

93
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,571
Well, that's where you live, isn't it?

94
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,453
What impertinence.

95
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,120
Hey, tell him where he comes from,
you wanna go fortune-telling.

96
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,673
Cheltenham,

97
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,825
Harrow,

98
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,804
Cambridge and, uh, India?

99
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,627
Quite right.

100
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,802
Blimey, he ain't a tec,
he's a blooming busybody.

101
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,141
If I may ask, sir, do you do this sort
of thing for a living at a music hall?

102
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,388
Well, I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

103
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,270
He's no gentleman.
He ain't, to interfere with a poor girl.

104
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,148
How do you do it, may I ask?

105
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,145
Simple phonetics.
The science of speech.

106
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,858
That's my profession.
Also my hobby.

107
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,819
Anyone can spot an Irishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue,

108
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,120
but I can place a man
within six miles.

109
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,374
I can place him
within two miles in London.

110
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,237
Sometimes within two streets.

111
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,873
Ought to be ashamed of himself,
unmanly coward.

112
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,121
Is there a living in that?

113
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,372
Oh, yes, quite a fat one.

114
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,884
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl--

115
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,376
Woman! Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly

116
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,380
or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship.

117
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,258
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you.

118
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,061
Woman who utters such disgusting
and depressing noises

119
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,636
has no right to be anywhere.
No right to live.

120
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,642
Remember that you're a human being
with a soul

121
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,404
and the divine gift
of articulate speech.

122
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,767
That your native language

123
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,573
is the language of Shakespeare
and Milton and the Bible.

124
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,947
Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

125
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,816
Ow!

126
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,244
Look at her
A prisoner of the gutters

127
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,713
Condemned by every syllable
She utters

128
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,794
By right
She should be taken out and hung

129
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,961
For the cold-blooded murder
Of the English tongue

130
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,211
Ow!

131
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,762
Heavens! What a sound!

132
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:38,296
This is what the British population
Calls an elementary education.

133
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,063
Come, sir,
I think you picked a poor example.

134
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,016
Did I?

135
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,056
Hear them down in Soho Square

136
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,810
Dropping H's everywhere

137
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,232
Speaking English any way they like

138
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,322
Hey, you, sir, did you go to school?

139
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,027
What do you take me for, a fool?

140
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,907
Well, no one taught him "take"
Instead of "tike"

141
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,446
Hear a Yorkshireman, or worse
Hear a Cornishman converse

142
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:05,042
I'd rather hear a choir singing flat

143
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,378
Chickens, cackling in a barn
Just like this one

144
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,335
Garn.

145
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,795
"Garn."

146
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,125
I ask you, sir,
what sort of word is that?

147
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,512
It's "ow" and "garn"
That keep her in her place

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,390
Not her wretched clothes
And dirty face

149
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,101
Why can't the English
Teach their children how to speak?

150
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,861
This verbal class distinction
By now, should be antique

151
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,525
If you spoke as she does, sir
Instead of the way you do

152
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,315
Why, you might be selling flowers too

153
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,608
PICKERING:
I beg your pardon.

154
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,081
An Englishman's way of speaking
Absolutely classifies him

155
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,334
The moment he talks

156
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,906
He makes some other Englishman
Despise him

157
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,252
One common language
I'm afraid we'll never get

158
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,338
Oh, why can't the English learn to

159
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:58,006
Set a good example to people
Whose English is painful to your ears

160
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,508
The Scotch and the Irish
Leave you close to tears

161
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:06,232
There even are places
Where English completely disappears

162
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,725
Why, in America
They haven't used it for years

163
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,319
Why can't the English
Teach their children how to speak?

164
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,985
Norwegians learn Norwegian
The Greeks are taught their Greek

165
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:21,155
In France every Frenchman knows
His language from A to Z

166
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,156
The French don't care
what they do actually,

167
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,658
as long as they pronounce it properly.

168
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,464
Arabians learn Arabian
With the speed of summer lightning

169
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,126
The Hebrews learn it backwards
Which is absolutely frightening

170
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,626
Use proper English
You're regarded as a freak

171
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,880
Oh, why can't the English...

172
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:45,969
Why can't the English
Learn to speak?

173
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,319
Thank you.

174
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,614
You see this creature
with her curbstone English?

175
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,568
The English that'll keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

176
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,570
Well, sir, in six months,
I could pass her off

177
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,122
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

178
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,906
I could even get her a job
as a lady's maid or a shop assistant,

179
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,580
which requires better English.

180
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,749
Here, what's that you say?

181
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,167
Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf.

182
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,086
You disgrace to the noble architecture
of these columns.

183
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,046
You incarnate insult
to the English language,

184
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,718
I could pass you off
as the Queen of Sheba.

185
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,930
Oh, you don't believe that, captain.

186
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,310
Anything's possible.

187
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,017
I myself am a student
of Indian dialects.

188
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,308
Are you?

189
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,311
Do you know Colonel Pickering,
the author of Spoken Sanskrit?

190
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,694
I am Colonel Pickering.
Who are you?

191
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,902
I'm Henry Higgins,
author of Higgins Universal Alphabet.

192
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,533
I came from India to meet you.

193
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,451
I was going to India to meet you.

194
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,040
- Higgins.
- Pickering.

195
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,866
PICKERING: Higgins.
- Where are you staying?

196
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,121
At the Carlton.

197
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,922
No, you're not.
You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street.

198
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,246
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.

199
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,762
- Right you are.
- Indian dialects always fascinated me.

200
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,915
Buy a flower, kind sir.
I'm short for me lodgings.

201
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,183
Liar.

202
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,215
You said you could change
half a crown.

203
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,098
You ought to be stuffed with nails,
you ought.

204
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:13,767
Here, take the whole blooming basket
for sixpence.

205
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,072
HIGGINS:
A reminder.

206
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,033
How many are there actually?

207
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,278
PICKERING:
How many what?

208
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,529
HIGGINS:
Indian dialects.

209
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,870
PICKERING:
No fewer than 147 distinct languages

210
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,736
are recorded as vernacular in India.

211
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,200
Ow.

212
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,252
Ah.

213
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,377
MAN 1:
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?

214
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,299
We've got a blooming heiress
in our midst.

215
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,888
Would you be looking
for a good butler, Eliza?

216
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,644
Well, you won't do.

217
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:53,267
It's rather dull in town
I think I'll take me to Paris

218
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:59,186
The missus wants to open up
The castle in Capri

219
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,650
Me doctor recommends
A quiet summer by the sea

220
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:15,788
CHORUS :
Wouldn't it be loverly

221
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,629
Where you bound for this year, Eliza?
Biarritz?

222
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:24,297
All I want is a room somewhere

223
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,967
Far away from the cold night air

224
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,219
With one enormous chair

225
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,772
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

226
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,978
Lots of chocolate for me to eat

227
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:45,571
Lots of coal makin' lots of heat

228
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,699
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet

229
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:53,407
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

230
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:01,920
Oh, so loverly sittin'
Abso-bloomin'-lutely still

231
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:10,298
I would never budge till spring
Crept over the windowsill

232
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:14,522
Someone's head restin' on my knee

233
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:19,404
Warm and tender as he can be

234
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,484
Who takes good care of me

235
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:29,241
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

236
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,737
Loverly, loverly

237
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:38,712
Loverly, loverly

238
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,956

Lots of coal makin' lots of heat

00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,782
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet

245
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:13,407
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

246
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:21,456
Oh, so loverly sittin'
Abso-bloomin'-lutely still

Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

252
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,283

Loverly

Wouldn't it be loverly?

260
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:45,267
JAMIE: Come on, Alfie, let's go home
now. This place is giving me the willies.

261
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,346
Home?
What do you want to go home for?

262
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,652
It's nearly 5:00.

263
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,145
My daughter, Eliza,
will be along soon.

264
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,977
She ought to be good
for a half a crown

265
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,363
for a father what loves her.

266
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,779
Loves her? That's a laugh.

267
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,397
You ain't been near her for months.

268
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,864
What's that got to do with it?

269
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,033
What's half a crown
after all I've give her?

270
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,332
When did you
ever give her anything?

271
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,536
Anything? I give her everything.

272
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,457
I give her the greatest gift
any human being can give to another.

273
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,787
Life.

274
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:15,342
I introduced her to this here planet,
I did, with all its wonders and marvels.

275
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,128
The sun that shines,
the moon that glows.

276
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,353
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

277
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,974
The whole ruddy city of London

278
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,931
to roam around in,
selling her blooming flowers.

279
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,232
I give her all that.

280
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,356
Then I disappears
and leaves her on her own to enjoy it.

281
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,734
Now, if that ain't worth half a crown
now and again,

282
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,732
I'll take my belt off
and give her what for.

283
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,194
You got a good heart, Alfie.

284
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,153
But you want that half a crown
out of Eliza,

285
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,074
you better have a good story
to go with it.

286
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,372
ALFIE:
Leave that to me, my boy.

287
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,700
Good morning, George.

288
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,451
Not a brass farthing.

289
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,787
ALFIE:
Good morning to you, Algernon.

290
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,462
Not a brass farthing.

291
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,090
MAN 1:
Move on, please. Come on.

292
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,667
Get your moving ass out of here.

293
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,633
On with it.

294
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,853
MAN 2:
Veggies. Get your veggies.

295
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,938
Here we are. Nice salad greens.

296
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,525
MAN 3:
Lovely Spanish onion...

297
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,825
MAN 4:
Five pounds...

298
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,379
MAN 2:
This is it. Nice bunches of veggies.

299
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,996
- Take your pick.
- There she is.

300
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,760
MAN 5: Tomatoes over here.
Nice garden tomatoes.

301
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,299
WOMAN:
Very tempting.

302
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,562
Why, Eliza, what a surprise.

303
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,976
Hop along, Charlie,
you're too old for me.

304
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,436
- Don't know your own daughter?
- How you gonna find her

305
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,186
- if you don't know what she looks like?
- I know her. Come on.

306
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,939
I'll find her.

307
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,851
Eliza, what a surprise.

308
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,636
Not a brass farthing.

309
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,349
Here, you come here, Eliza.

310
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,310
I ain't gonna take me
hard-earned wages

311
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,361
and let you pass them on
to a bloody pub keeper.

312
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,700
Eliza, you wouldn't have the heart
to send me home to your stepmother

313
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,659
without a drop of liquid protection,
now, would you?

314
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,000
Stepmother indeed.

315
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,866
Well, I'm willing to marry her.

316
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,293
It's me that suffers by it.
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

317
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,593
Just because I ain't
her lawful husband.

318
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,008
Come on, slip your old dad
just half a crown to go home on.

319
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,179
Well, I had a bit of luck myself
last night.

320
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,508
Yeah?

321
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,392
So here.

322
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:58,306
But don't keep coming around
counting on half crowns from me.

323
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,601
Thank you, Eliza.

324
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,654
You're a noble daughter.

325
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:08,698
Beer, beer, glorious beer

326
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,566
Fill yourself right up

327
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,413
WOMAN 1:
Do you know where she's been?

328
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,328
WOMAN 2:
Yeah, I know. Wayne is always asking.

329
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,666
That one, Ginny.

330
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,591
WOMAN 3:
Leave me alone.

331
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,180
HIGGINS: You see this creature
with her curbstone English?

332
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,729
The English that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

333
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,149
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

334
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,936
I could even get her a job
as a lady's maid or a shop assistant,

335
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,651
which requires better English.

336
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:59,656
HIGGINS: You disgrace to the noble
architecture of these columns.

337
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,085
I could even get her a job
as a lady's maid or a shop assistant,

338
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,629
which requires better English.

339
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,150
A.

340
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,034
E. U. A...

341
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,413
Now, how many vowel sounds
do you think you heard altogether?

342
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,912
I believe I counted 24.

343
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,253
- Wrong by a hundred.
- What?

344
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,498
To be exact, you heard 130.

345
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,170
Now, listen to them one at a time.

346
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,669
Must I? I'm really quite done up
for one morning.

347
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,954
Your name, please.
Your name, miss.

348
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,999
My name is of no concern
to you whatsoever.

349
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,374
One moment, please.

350
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:34,009
Oh, London is getting
so dirty these days.

351
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,468
PEARCE: I'm Mrs. Pearce,
the housekeeper. Can I help you?

352
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,140
Oh, good morning, missus.

353
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,178
I'd like to see the professor, please.

354
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,892
Could you tell me what it's about?

355
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:47,732
- It's business of a personal nature.
- Oh.

356
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,980
One moment, please.

357
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,369
Mr. Higgins.

358
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:01,788
What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

359
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,286
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

360
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,578
A young woman?

361
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,083
What does she want?

362
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,594
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

363
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,916
I should have sent her away,

364
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,721
only I thought perhaps you wanted her
to talk into your machine.

365
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,715
- Has she an interesting accent?
- Simply ghastly, Mr. Higgins.

366
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,218
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

367
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,891
Very well, sir. It's for you to say.

368
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,889
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

369
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,902
We'll set her talking and then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech,

370
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,106
then in Broad Romic, and then
we'll get her on the phonograph

371
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,358
so that you can turn her on
whenever you want

372
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,860
with the written transcript
before you.

373
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,744
This is the young woman, sir.

374
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,042
Good morning, my good man.

375
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,535
Might I have the pleasure
of a word with you face-to-face?

376
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,038
Oh, no, no, no.
This is the girl I jotted down last night.

377
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,210
She's no use. I've got all the records
I want of the Lisson Grove lingo.

378
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,210
I'm not gonna waste
another cylinder on that.

379
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,962
Now, be off with you.
I don't want you.

380
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,094
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't heard what I come for yet.

381
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,842
Did you tell him I come in a taxi?

382
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,104
Nonsense, girl.

383
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,175
What do you think a gentleman like
Mr. Higgins cares what you came in?

384
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,142
Oh, we are proud.

385
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,142
Well, he ain't above giving lessons.
Not him.

386
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,444
I heard him say so.

387
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,687
Well, I ain't come here
to ask for any compliment,

388
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,439
and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

389
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:15,992
Good enough for what?

390
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,855
Good enough for you.

391
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,781
Now you know, don't you?
I'm come to have lessons, I am.

392
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,952
And to pay for them too.
Make no mistake.

393
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,247
Well...

394
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,115
And what do you expect me to say?

395
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,127
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

396
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,337
Don't I tell you
I'm bringing you business?

397
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,799
Pickering, should we ask this baggage
to sit down

398
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,139
or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

399
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,715
Ow! I won't be called a baggage.

400
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,640
Not when I've offered to pay
like any lady.

401
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,232
PICKERING:
What do you want, my girl?

402
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,610
I-- I want to be a lady in a flower shop

403
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,147
instead of selling at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

404
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,991
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

405
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,657
He said he could teach me.
Well, here I am.

406
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,907
Ready to pay him,
not asking any favor.

407
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,499
And he treats me as if I was dirt.

408
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:11,915
I know what lessons cost as well
as you do, and I'm ready to pay.

409
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,127
How much?

410
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,418
Now you're talking.

411
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,262
I thought you'd come off it when you
saw a chance of getting back

412
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:22,799
a bit of what you chucked at me.

413
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,892
- You'd had a drop in, hadn't you, eh?
- Sit down.

414
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,848
If you're going to make
a compliment of it--

415
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,138
Sit down!

416
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,942
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

417
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,397
What's your name?

418
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,027
Eliza Doolittle.

419
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,744
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

420
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,284
Oh.

421
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,832
I don't mind if I do.

422
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:51,746
Now, how much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

423
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,367
Oh, I know what's right.

424
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,344
A lady friend of mine gets French
lessons for 18 pence an hour

425
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,585
from a real French gentleman.

426
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,838
Well, you wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same

427
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,590
for teaching me my own language
as you would for French.

428
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,303
So I won't give more than a shilling.

429
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,473
Take it or leave it.

430
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:14,021
Do you know, Pickering, if you think
of a shilling not as a simple shilling

431
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,980
but as a percentage
of this girl's income,

432
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:21,031
it works out as fully equivalent

433
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,664
of 60 or 70 pounds
from a millionaire.

434
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,155
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

435
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,539
Sixty pounds?

436
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,996
What are you talking about?
Where would I get 60 pounds?

437
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,417
I never offered you 60 pounds.

438
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,785
- Hold your tongue.
- But I ain't got 60 pounds.

439
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,382
Don't cry, you silly girl.

440
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,917
Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

441
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,011
Somebody's going to touch you
with a broomstick

442
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,547
if you don't stop sniveling.
Sit down!

443
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,926
Oh, anybody would think
you was my father.

444
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,812
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

445
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,520
Here.

446
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,021
- What's this for?
- To wipe your eyes.

447
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,034
To wipe any part of your face
that feels moist.

448
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,697
And remember, that's your
handkerchief and that's your sleeve.

449
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,486
And don't confuse the one
with the other

450
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,280
if you want to become
a lady in a shop.

451
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,583
It's no use to talk to her like that,
Mr. Higgins.

452
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,117
She doesn't understand you.

453
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,040
Here, give the handkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you.

454
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,131
Higgins, I'm interested.

455
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,836
What about your boast that you
could pass her off as a duchess

456
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,377
at the Embassy Ball, eh?

457
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:26,381
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you can make that good.

458
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:30,354
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

459
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,466
I'll even pay for the lessons.

460
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,443
Oh, you're real good.
Thank you, captain.

461
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,982
You know, it's almost irresistible.

462
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,653
She's so deliciously low.

463
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,321
So horribly dirty.

464
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,569
I ain't dirty.

465
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,910
I washed my face and hands
before I come, I did.

466
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,156
I'll take it.

467
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,327
I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

468
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:57,167
We'll start today. Now. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

469
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,174
Sandpaper if it won't come off
any other way.

470
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,416
- Is there a good fire in the kitchen?
- Yes, but--

471
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,009
Take all her clothes, burn them,
and order new ones.

472
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,304
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

473
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:10,346
You're no gentleman.
You're not to talk of such things.

474
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:11,974
I'm a good girl, I am.

475
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,391
And I know what the likes of you are,
I do.

476
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,851
We want none of your
slum prudery here, young woman.

477
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,193
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

478
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,648
Now take her away, Mrs. Pearce.

479
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,568
If she gives you any trouble,
wallop her.

480
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,647
I'll call the police, I will.

481
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,402
I've got no place to put her.

482
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,244
- Well, put her in the dustbin.
- Ow!

483
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,620
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

484
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,997
You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins,
really, you must.

485
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,825
You can't walk
over everybody like this.

486
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,172
I?

487
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:45,049
Walk over everybody?

488
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,505
My dear Mrs. Pearce,
my dear Pickering.

489
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,506
I had no intention
of walking over anybody.

490
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,548
I merely suggested
we should be kind to this poor girl.

491
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,603
I didn't express myself clearly

492
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,557
because I didn't wish to hurt
her delicacy.

493
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:58,808
Or yours.

494
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,109
But, sir, you can't take a girl up
like that

495
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,694
as if you were
picking up a pebble on the beach.

496
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,070
Why not?

497
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,356
Why not?

498
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,029
But you don't know
anything about her.

499
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,948
What about her parents?
She may be married.

500
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,527
Garn.

501
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,292
There.
As the girl very properly says, "Garn."

502
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,076
Who'd marry me?

503
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,037
By George, Eliza.

504
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:27,633
The streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men

505
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,880
shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

506
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,296
Here. I'm going.

507
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,394
He's off his chump, he is.

508
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,099
- I don't want no barmies teaching me.
- Oh, mad, am I?

509
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,440
All right,
don't ring up and order those clothes.

510
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,856
- Throw her out.
- Stop, Mr. Higgins, I won't allow it.

511
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,185
Go home to your parents.

512
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,030
I ain't got no parents.

513
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,815
There you are.
She ain't got no parents.

514
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,489
What's all the fuss?
Nobody wants her.

515
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,657
She's no use to anybody but me.
Take her upstairs.

516
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,116
But what's to become of her?
Is she to be paid anything?

517
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,286
Oh, do be sensible, sir.

518
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,865
What would she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

519
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,671
She'll only drink
if you give her money.

520
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,165
Oh, you are a brute. It's a lie.

521
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,586
Nobody ever saw
the sign of liquor on me.

522
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,755
Oh, sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let him speak to me like that.

523
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,925
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

524
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,425
Oh, no, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

525
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,678
Well, have you, Eliza?

526
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,220
I got my feelings
same as anyone else.

527
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:23,604
Mr. Higgins, I must know
on what terms the girl is to be here.

528
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,232
What's to become of her
when you've finished your teaching?

529
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,020
You must look ahead a little, sir.

530
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,363
What's to become of her
if we leave her in the gutter?

531
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,819
- Answer me that, Mrs. Pearce.
- That's her own business, not yours.

532
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,121
When I'm done, we'll throw her back,
then it will be her own business again.

533
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,624
That will be all right, won't it?

534
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,497
You've no feeling heart in you.

535
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,205
You don't care for nothing
but yourself.

536
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,876
I've had enough of this.
I'm going, I am.

537
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,956
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
you ought.

538
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,421
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

539
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,009
How do I know
what might be in them?

540
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:02,563
I've heard of girls being drugged
by the likes of you.

541
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,768
Pledge of good faith.

542
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,188
I'll take one half

543
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,437
and you take the other.

544
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,818
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

545
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,371
You'll live on them, eh?

546
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,158
I wouldn't have ate it,
only I'm too ladylike

547
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,620
to take it out of my mouth.

548
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,870
Think of it, Eliza.

549
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:29,131
Think of chocolates
and taxis and gold and diamonds.

550
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,586
Ow! I don't want no gold
and no diamonds.

551
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,508
I'm a good girl, I am.

552
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,966
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

553
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,808
If this girl's gonna put herself
in your hands for six months

554
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,394
for an experiment in teaching,

555
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,979
she must understand thoroughly
what she's doing.

556
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,188
HIGGINS:
Mm.

557
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:51,727
Eliza, you are to stay here
for the next six months

558
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:56,952
learning how to speak beautifully,
like a lady in a florist shop.

559
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,066
If you're good
and do whatever you're told,

560
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:02,293
you shall sleep in a proper bedroom,
have lots to eat

561
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:06,164
and money to buy chocolates
and take rides in taxis.

562
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,583
But if you are naughty and idle,

563
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,542
you shall sleep in the back kitchen
amongst the black beetles

564
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:15,173
and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

565
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,633
At the end of six months,

566
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,143
you shall be taken
to Buckingham Palace

567
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,885
in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

568
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,849
If the king finds out
that you're not a lady,

569
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,230
the police will take you
to the Tower of London

570
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,228
where your head will be cut off

571
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,360
as a warning
to other presumptuous flower girls.

572
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:39,784
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present

573
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,830
of seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

574
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,366
If you refuse this offer,

575
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,830
you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl

576
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:55,593
and the angels will weep for you.

577
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,216
Now, are you satisfied, Pickering?

578
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,218
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

579
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,640
Oh, could I put it more plainly
or fairly, Mrs. Pearce?

580
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:06,889
Come with me, Eliza.

581
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,520
That's right, Mrs. Pearce.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

582
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,898
You're a great bully, you are.

583
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,815
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me.

584
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:15,983
Don't answer back, girl.

585
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,321
ELIZA: If I'd known what I was letting
myself in for, I wouldn't have come here.

586
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,858
I've always been a good girl,
I am, and I won't be put upon.

587
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,124
In six months--

588
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,275
In three if she has a good ear
and a quick tongue.

589
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,874
--I'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

590
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,330
I'll make a queen
of that barbarous wretch.

591
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,419
ELIZA:
I've never had a bath in my life.

592
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,013
Not what you'd call a proper one.

593
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:45,298
You know, you can't be a nice girl
inside if you're dirty outside.

594
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:49,024
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

595
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:57,861
Oh, I couldn't sleep here, missus.
It's too good for the likes of me.

596
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,896
I should be afraid to touch anything.

597
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,993
I ain't a duchess yet, you know?

598
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,042
Oh, what's this?
This where you wash clothes?

599
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,959
This is where we wash
ourselves, Eliza.

600
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,877
And where I'm going to wash you.

601
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:20,012
You expect me to get into that
and wet myself all over?

602
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,625
Not me.

603
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,846
I shall catch my death.

604
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,055
Come along now.

605
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,901
Come along. Take your clothes off.

606
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,192
Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

607
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:45,073
- Here, come on, help me take these.
- Ow! No, I won't.

608
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,952
PEARCE: Come out of that.
- No, I won't.

609
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,699
PEARCE: Everyone.
- No!

610
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,830
I won't. Take your hands off me.

611
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,079
- No.
PEARCE: Oh, dear.

612
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,620
No. Ow!

613
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,040
- No, I won't. Let go.
PEARCE: Eliza, keep still.

614
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,559
PEARCE: Take a bath.
- No!

615
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,726
No!

616
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,814
I'm a good girl, I am.

617
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,808
PEARCE: Well, they won't like the
smell of you if you don't have a bath.

618
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,691
ELIZA:
It ain't right. It ain't decent.

619
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,861
Let go of my coat.

620
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,320
ELIZA:
Take your hands off me.

621
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,163
PEARCE:
Come here.

622
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,697
ELIZA: No.
PEARCE: I won't hurt you.

623
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,502
ELIZA:
Let me go.

624
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,536
Take your hands off me.

625
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,710
I'm a good girl, I am.

626
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,706
Take your hands off me, you hear.

627
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,723
PEARCE:
Eliza, I won't have it.

628
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,465
I wouldn't hurt you.

629
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,889
Higgins, forgive the bluntness,

630
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:57,311
but if I'm to be in this business,
I shall feel responsible for the girl.

631
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,771
I hope it's clearly understood
that no advantage

632
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,231
is to be taken of her position.

633
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,981
What, that thing?
Sacred, I assure you.

634
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,784
Come now, Higgins,
you know what I mean.

635
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,147
This is no trifling matter.

636
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:10,664
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

637
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,331
Have you ever met a man
of good character

638
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,577
where women are concerned?

639
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,208
Yes, very frequently.

640
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:18,456
Well, I haven't.

641
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,957
I find the moment
I let a woman make friends with me,

642
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:25,169
she becomes jealous, exacting,
suspicious and a damned nuisance.

643
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,682
And I find the moment
that I make friends with a woman,

644
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,434
I become selfish and tyrannical.

645
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:33,346
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

646
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:37,887
Well, after all, Pickering
I'm an ordinary man

647
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:42,403
Who desires nothing more
Than just an ordinary chance

648
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:47,187
To live exactly as he likes
And do precisely what he wants

649
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:51,704
An average man am I
Of no eccentric whim

650
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,988
Who likes to live his life
Free of strife

651
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:59,043
Doing whatever he thinks
Is best for him

652
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:03,672
Well, just an ordinary man

653
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:10,835
But let a woman in your life
And your serenity is through

654
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,802
She'll redecorate your home
From the cellar to the dome

655
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:17,894
Then go on to the enthralling fun
Of overhauling you

656
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:24,522
Let a woman in your life
And you're up against a wall

657
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,493
Make a plan and you will find
She has something else in mind

658
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,654
And so rather than do either
You do something else

659
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,413
That neither likes at all

660
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:38,454
You want to talk of Keats or Milton
She only wants to talk of love

661
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:43,963
You go to see a play or ballet
And spend it searching for her glove

662
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:49,509
Let a woman in your life
And you invite eternal strife

663
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:55,891
Let them buy their wedding bands
For those anxious little hands

664
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,927
I'd be equally as willing
For a dentist to be drilling

665
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,812
Than to ever let a woman in my life

666
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:09,613
I'm a very gentle man
Even-tempered and good-natured

667
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,699
Who you never hear complain

668
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:16,195
Who has the milk of human kindness
By the quart in every vein

669
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:20,659
A patient man am I
Down to my fingertips

670
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,872
The sort who never could
Ever would

671
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:28,094
Let an insulting remark escape his lips

672
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,800
A very gentle man

673
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:40,144
But let a woman in your life
And patience hasn't got a chance

674
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,770
She will beg you for advice
Your reply will be concise

675
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,398
And she'll listen very nicely

676
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,944
Then go out
And do precisely what she wants

677
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:53,775
You are a man of grace and polish
Who never spoke above a hush

678
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:59,579
Now all at once you're using language
That would make a sailor blush

679
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:04,786
Let a woman in your life
And you're plunging in a knife

680
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:11,297
Let the others of my sex
Tie the knot around their necks

681
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,626
I'd prefer a new edition
Of the Spanish Inquisition

682
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:18,763
Than to ever let a woman in my life

683
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,229
I'm a quiet-living man

684
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:27,475
Who prefers to spend the evenings
In the silence of his room

685
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:31,939
Who likes an atmosphere as restful
As an undiscovered tomb

686
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:36,412
A pensive man am I
Of philosophic joys

687
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:39,735
Who likes to meditate, contemplate

688
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:45,041
Free from humanity's mad
Inhuman noise

689
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,541
A quiet living man

690
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:56,429
But let a woman in your life
And your sabbatical is through

691
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:59,295
In a line that never ends
Come an army of her friends

692
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,682
Come to jabber and to chatter

693
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:04,059
And to tell her what the matter
Is with you

694
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,229
She'll have a booming
Boisterous family

695
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,107
Who will descend
On you en masse

696
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:15,435
She'll have a large Wagnerian mother
With a voice that shatters glass

697
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:17,404
Let a woman in your life

698
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,527
Let a woman in your life

699
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:45,675
I shall never let a woman in my life

700
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:48,976
MAN:
Get out of here.

701
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,517
The two of you get out too.

702
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,860
Come on, Doolittle.

703
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:56,395
And remember,
drinks are to be paid for or not drunk.

704
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,105
Thanks for your hospitality, George.

705
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,372
Send the bill to Buckingham Palace.
Come on.

706
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,914
Well, Alfie, there's nothing else to do.
I guess it's back to work.

707
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,160
What?

708
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,961
Don't you dare mention
that word in my presence again.

709
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,455
Look at all these poor blighters
down here.

710
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:16,208
I used to do that sort of thing once,
just for exercise.

711
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:19,343
It's not worth it.
Takes up your whole day.

712
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,011
Oh, don't worry, boys.
We'll get out of this somehow.

713
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,140
How do you think
you're going to do that, Alfie?

714
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,637
How? Same as always.

715
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,940
Faith, hope and a little bit of luck.

716
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:33,645
The Lord above gave man
An arm of iron

717
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:37,607
So he could do his job
And never shirk

718
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,949
The Lord above gave man
An arm of iron but

719
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,527
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

720
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:49,544
Someone else'll do
The blinkin' work

721
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:53,418
With a little bit
With a little bit

722
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:57,166
ALL : With a little bit of luck
You'll never work

723
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,920
The Lord above made liquor
For temptation

724
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:04,684
To see if man could turn away
From sin

725
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:09,018
The Lord above made liquor
For temptation but

726
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:12,595
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

727
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:16,612
When temptation comes
You'll give right in

728
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:20,396
With a little bit
With a little bit

729
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:23,952
With a little bit of luck
You'll give right in

730
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:27,907
Oh, you can walk
The straight and narrow

731
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:31,829
But with a little bit of luck
You'll run amuck

732
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,500
The gentle sex
Was made for man to marry

733
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,300
To share his nest
And see his food is cooked

734
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:43,676
The gentle sex
Was made for man to marry but

735
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:47,255
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

736
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:51,272
You can have it all
And not get hooked

737
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:55,146
With a little bit
With a little bit

738
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:59,065
With a little bit of luck
You won't get hooked

739
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,945
With a little bit
With a little bit

740
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,624
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

741
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:10,445
They're always throwin'
Goodness at you

742
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:14,372
But with a little bit of luck
A man can duck

743
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,132
The Lord above made man
To help his neighbor

744
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,916
No matter where
On land, or sea, or foam

745
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:26,391
The Lord above made man
To help his neighbor but

746
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,974
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

747
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:33,101
When he comes around
You won't be home

748
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,773
With a little bit
With a little bit

749
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,943
With a little bit of luck
You won't be home

750
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:45,861
With a little bit
With a little bit

751
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:50,082
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

752
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:51,873
HARRY:
You make a good suffragette, Alfie.

753
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,538
MAN:
Oh, get along with you.

754
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,297
Why, there's the lucky man now.

755
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,625
The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.

756
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,632
What are you doing in Eliza's house?

757
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:10,394
Her former residence.

758
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,927
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.

759
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,981
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

760
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:18,194
- What are you talking about?
- Your daughter, Eliza.

761
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,266
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

762
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,111
Well, what about Eliza?

763
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:26,067
Oh! He don't know.
Her own father and he don't know.

764
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:32,236
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

765
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:35,452
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

766
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,673
- And ain't been home for three days.
- Go on.

767
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,125
Then this morning,
I get a message from her.

768
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,416
She wants her things sent over.

769
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,720
To 27A Wimpole Street,

770
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,005
care of Professor Higgins.

771
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,723
- And what things does she want?
- What?

772
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:57,351
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

773
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,850
"But," she says,

774
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:05,154
"never mind about
sending any clothes."

775
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,817
I knew she had a career
in front of her.

776
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,372
Harry boy,
we're in for a booze-up.

777
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:17,196
The sun is shining
on Alfred P. Doolittle.

778
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:21,043
A man was made
To help support his children

779
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,800
Which is the right
And proper thing to do

780
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:29,174
A man was made
To help support his children but

781
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:32,684
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

782
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:36,847
They'll go out
And start supporting you

783
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:40,518
With a little bit
With a little bit

784
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:44,438
With a little bit of luck
They'll work for you

785
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:48,149
With a little bit
With a little bit

786
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:52,161
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

787
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,247
Oh, it's a crime
For man to go philanderin'

788
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:07,049
And fill his wife's poor heart
With grief and doubt

789
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:11,255
Oh, it's a crime
For a man to go philanderin' but

790
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,847
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

791
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,774
You can see
The bloodhound don't find out

792
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:22,595
With a little bit
With a little bit

793
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,982
With a little bit of luck
She won't find out

794
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,360
MAN: Charlie, over here.
- With a little bit

795
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:30,238
With a little bit

796
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:34,865
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

797
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:42,504
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

798
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,342
The mail, sir.

799
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,469
Pay the bills
and say no to the invitations.

800
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:57,676
ELIZA:
A.

801
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:01,349
A.

802
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:07,189
A.

803
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:13,398
A.

804
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:35,428
A.

805
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:39,295
A!

806
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,684
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

807
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:44,061
Making her say her alphabet
over and over

808
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,058
from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

809
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,611
You'll exhaust yourself.
When will it stop?

810
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,646
When she does it properly,
of course.

811
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,489
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

812
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:54,744
There's another letter

813
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:56,986
from that American millionaire,
Ezra D. Wallingford.

814
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:59,488
He still wants you to lecture
for his Moral Reform League.

815
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,740
Yes, well, throw it away.

816
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,702
It's the third letter
he's written you, sir.

817
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,702
- You should at least answer it.
- All right.

818
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:07,584
Leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

819
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,884
If you please, sir,
there's a dustman downstairs,

820
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,589
Alfred P. Doolittle,
who wants to see you.

821
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,880
He says you have his daughter here.

822
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:19,974
PICKERING:
I say.

823
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,639
Well, send the blackguard up.

824
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,018
PICKERING:
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

825
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:26,345
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

826
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:29,691
Whether he is or not, I'm afraid
we'll have some trouble with him.

827
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:30,937
No, I think not.

828
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:34,279
Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me, not I with him.

829
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:39,283
Doolittle, sir.

830
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,122
Professor Higgins?

831
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,000
HIGGINS:
Here.

832
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,747
Where?

833
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,839
Oh, good morning, governor.

834
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:56,014
I come about
a very serious matter, governor.

835
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,141
Brought up in Hounslow.

836
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,135
Mother Welsh, I should think.

837
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,678
What is it you want, Doolittle?

838
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,562
I want my daughter,
that's what I want, you see?

839
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,979
Well, of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

840
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:13,569
I'm glad to see you have
a spark of family feeling left.

841
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,904
She's in there.
Yes, take her away at once.

842
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,112
What?

843
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,361
Take her away.

844
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:22,072
Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

845
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,993
Now, is this reasonable, governor?

846
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:28,213
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

847
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,334
The girl belongs to me. You got her.

848
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,791
Where do I come in?

849
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:36,211
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me.

850
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,302
You sent her here on purpose.

851
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:42,047
Now, don't take a man
up like that, governor.

852
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:43,431
The police shall take you up.

853
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,466
This is a plan, a plot
to extort money by threats.

854
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,522
I shall telephone the police.

855
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:52,056
Have I asked you
for a brass farthing?

856
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,901
I'll leave it to this gentleman here.
Have I said a word about money?

857
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,898
What else did you come for?

858
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,740
Well...

859
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:02,156
What would a bloke come for?

860
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,365
Be human, governor.

861
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,040
Alfred, you sent her here
on purpose.

862
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,920
So help me, governor, I never did.

863
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,496
Then how did you know
she was here?

864
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,421
I'd tell you, governor,
if you'd only let me get a word in.

865
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:21,551
I'm willing to tell you.
I'm wanting to tell you.

866
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,049
I'm waiting to tell you.

867
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:26,386
You know, Pickering,

868
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,387
this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

869
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,390
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

870
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,693
"I'm willing to tell you.
I'm wanting to tell you.

871
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:39,107
I'm waiting to tell you."
That's the Welsh strain in him.

872
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,948
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send her?

873
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,164
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to hear about it.

874
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:48,576
She said she didn't want no clothes.

875
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,366
What was I to think from that,
governor?

876
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:53,619
I ask you, as a parent,
what was I to think?

877
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:57,753
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

878
00:54:57,962 --> 00:54:59,422
Just so, governor, that's right.

879
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,710
Yes.

880
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,553
Mrs. Pearce.

881
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,718
Mrs. Pearce, Eliza's father
has come to take her away.

882
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,048
Give her to him, will you?

883
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,473
Now, wait a minute, governor,
wait a minute.

884
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,564
You and me is men of the world,
ain't we?

885
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,310
Oh, men of the world, are we?

886
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,903
- Yes, you better go, Mrs. Pearce.
- I think so indeed, sir.

887
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,150
Here, governor.

888
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:26,031
I've took a sort of a fancy
to you and--

889
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:32,156
If you want the girl, well, I ain't so set
on having her back home again,

890
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:35,671
but what I might be
open to is an arrangement.

891
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,205
All I ask is my rights as a father.

892
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:42,129
You're the last man alive
to expect me to let her go for nothing.

893
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,510
Oh, I can see you're one
of the straight sort, governor.

894
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:48,638
So, what's a 5-pound note to you?

895
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,506
And what's Eliza to me?

896
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,184
I think you ought to know, Doolittle,

897
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,312
that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

898
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,230
Of course they are, governor.

899
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,939
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

900
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,240
Do you mean to say you'd sell
your daughter for 50 pounds?

901
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,945
Have you no morals, man?

902
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,406
No, no,
I can't afford them, governor.

903
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:12,738
Neither could you
if you was as poor as me.

904
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,373
Not that I mean any harm,
mind you.

905
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,420
But if Eliza is gonna have
a bit out of this,

906
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,825
why not me too, eh?

907
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:21,094
Why not?

908
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:25,755
Well, look at it my way.

909
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,926
What am I? I ask you, what am I?

910
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,546
I'm one of the undeserving poor,
that's what I am.

911
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,644
Now, think
what that means to a man.

912
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:38,019
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all of time.

913
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:40,519
If there's anything going
and I puts in for a bit of it,

914
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:41,821
it's always the same story.

915
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,784
"You're undeserving
so you can't have it."

916
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,985
But my needs is as great
as the most deserving widows

917
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:51,197
that ever got money out
of six different charities in one week

918
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:53,539
for the death of the same husband.

919
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:57,414
I don't need less than
a deserving man, I need more.

920
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,793
I don't eat less hearty than he does.

921
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,790
And I drink, oh, a lot more.

922
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:06,843
I'm playing straight with you.
I ain't pretending to be deserving.

923
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,089
No, I'm undeserving.

924
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:11,301
And I mean to go on
being undeserving.

925
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,222
I like it, and that's the truth.

926
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:17,271
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature

927
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,346
to do him out of the price
of his own daughter,

928
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:23,982
what he's brought up, fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow

929
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,531
till she's growed big enough

930
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:29,574
to be interesting
to you two gentlemen?

931
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,280
Well, is 5 pounds unreasonable?
I put it to you.

932
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,703
And I leave it to you.

933
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:42,418
You know, Pickering, if we took
this man in hand for three months,

934
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,416
he could choose
between a seat in the cabinet

935
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,208
and a popular pulpit in Wales.

936
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:48,923
We'd better give him a fiver.

937
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,093
He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

938
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,222
Oh, not me, governor.
So help me, I won't.

939
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:55,809
Just one good spree
for myself and the missus.

940
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:59,095
Giving pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

941
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,980
And satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been thrown away.

942
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:03,398
You couldn't spend it better.

943
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:06,226
Oh, this is irresistible.
Let's give him 10.

944
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,152
No, the missus wouldn't have the heart
to spend 10, governor.

945
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:10,951
Ten pounds is a lot of money.

946
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:14,865
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to happiness.

947
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:19,365
No, you give me what I ask, governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

948
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,540
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality, Doolittle.

949
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,580
Why don't you marry
that missus of yours, eh?

950
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,753
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

951
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,763
Who told you that, governor?

952
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:33,795
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally.

953
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,774
If we listen to this man
for another minute,

954
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,354
we shall have no convictions left.

955
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,189
- Five pounds, I think you said.
- Thank you, governor, thank you.

956
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,645
Are you sure you won't have 10?

957
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:48,475
- No, no, perhaps another time.
- I won't, I won't, I won't.

958
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,192
I beg your pardon, miss.

959
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:53,032
ELIZA: I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

960
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:55,029
Blimey, it's Eliza.

961
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:57,701
Well, I never thought
she'd clean up so good-looking.

962
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,740
She does me credit,
don't she, governor?

963
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:02,334
Here, what you doing here?

964
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,040
Now, now, you hold your tongue.

965
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,290
And don't you give these gentlemen
none of your lip.

966
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,213
If you have any trouble
with her, governor,

967
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,801
give her a few licks of the strap.

968
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:13,336
That's the way to improve her mind.

969
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:14,971
Well, good morning, gentlemen.

970
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,467
- Cheerio, Eliza.
- Mah!

971
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:20,972
There's a man for you.

972
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:23,733
A philosophical genius
of the first water.

973
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:27,106
Mrs. Pearce,
write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford

974
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:28,734
and tell him if he wants a lecturer

975
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,781
to get in touch
with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle,

976
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,565
a common dustman, one of the most
original moralists in England.

977
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:34,859
Yes, sir.

978
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,952
Here, what did he come for?

979
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,197
Say your vowels.

980
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,159
I know my vowels.
I knew them before I come.

981
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:41,489
If you know them, say them.

982
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:44,464
A, E, I, O, U.

983
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:45,915
Stop.

984
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,285
A, E, I, O, U.

985
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,302
That's what said, A, E, I, O, U.

986
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,085
That's what I been saying
for three days

987
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,469
and I won't say them no more.

988
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:57,643
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

989
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:59,295
There's no use explaining, Pickering.

990
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:02,103
As a military man, you know that.
Drilling is what she needs.

991
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,928
Now, leave her alone or she'll be
turning to you for sympathy.

992
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:08,194
Very well, if you insist, but have
a little patience with her, Higgins.

993
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:09,767
Of course.

994
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:11,362
Now say "A."

995
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,607
You ain't got no heart, you ain't.

996
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,949
- A.
- A.

997
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:18,065
- A.
- A.

998
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,032
- A.
- A.

999
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,332
Eliza.

1000
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:25,405
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out

1001
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:28,003
or there'll be no lunch, no dinner

1002
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,128
and no chocolates.

1003
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:45,772
Just you wait, Henry Higgins
Just you wait

1004
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:50,266
You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late

1005
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,611
You'll be broke
And I'll have money

1006
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,896
Will I help you?
Don't be funny

1007
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:59,660
Just you wait, Henry Higgins
Just you wait

1008
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:03,785
Just you wait, Henry Higgins,
Till you're sick

1009
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:08,334
And you screams
To fetch a doctor double-quick

1010
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,000
I'll be off a second later
And go straight to the theater

1011
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:17,472
Ho, ho, ho, Henry Higgins
Just you wait

1012
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,802
Ooh, Henry Higgins

1013
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:26,602
Just you wait
Until we're swimmin' in the sea

1014
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,267
Ooh, Henry Higgins

1015
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:34,859
And you gets a cramp
A little ways from me

1016
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:36,937
When you yell you're gonna drown

1017
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,282
I'll get dressed and go to town

1018
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,488
Ho, ho, ho, Henry Higgins

1019
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:44,159
Ho, ho, ho, Henry Higgins

1020
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:48,788
Just you wait

1021
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,786
One day I'll be famous

1022
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:56,342
I'll be proper and prim

1023
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,837
Go to St. James so often

1024
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,629
I will call it St. Jim

1025
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:05,012
One evening the king will say:

1026
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,812
"Oh, Liza, old thing

1027
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,766
I want all of England

1028
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:14,108
Your praises to sing"

1029
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:18,574
Next week on the 20th of May

1030
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:24,067
I proclaim Liza Doolittle Day

1031
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:29,083
All the people will celebrate
The glory of you

1032
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:34,958
And whatever you wish and want
I gladly will do

1033
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:40,839
"Thanks a lot, king," says I
In a manner well-bred

1034
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:46,389
"But all I want is Henry Higgins' head"

1035
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:51,774
- Done
- Says the king with a stroke

1036
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:56,107
Guard, run and bring in the bloke

1037
01:02:56,315 --> 01:03:01,105
Then they'll march you, Henry Higgins
To the wall

1038
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,910
- And the king will tell me:
- Liza, sound the call

1039
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:09,036
As they raise their rifles higher

1040
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,964
I'll shout, "Ready, aim, fire"

1041
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,128
Ho, ho, ho, Henry Higgins

1042
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:20,086
Down you'll go, Henry Higgins

1043
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,837
Just you wait

1044
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,487
A.

1045
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:50,203
A.

1046
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:55,538
A.

1047
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,841
A.

1048
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,304
All right, Eliza, say it again.

1049
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:10,969
"The rain
in Spain stays mainly in the plain."

1050
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:16,233
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

1051
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,476
Didn't I say that?

1052
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,108
No, Eliza, you didn't "say" that.

1053
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,234
You didn't even say that.

1054
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:24,691
Every night before you get into bed,
where you used to say your prayers,

1055
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:29,493
I want you to say, "The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain,"

1056
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,160
50 times.

1057
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:36,118
You'll get much further with the Lord
if you learn not to offend his ears.

1058
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,711
Now for your H's.

1059
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,956
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

1060
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,129
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

1061
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:46,258
Oh, well, I suppose you can't
expect her to get it right the first time.

1062
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,046
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

1063
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,388
Now.

1064
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,766
You see that flame?

1065
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,265
Every time you pronounce
the letter H correctly,

1066
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,517
the flame will waver.

1067
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,519
And every time you drop your H,
the flame will remain stationary.

1068
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:03,772
That's how you'll know
if you've done it correctly.

1069
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,694
In time, your ear will hear
the difference.

1070
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:07,243
See it better in the mirror.

1071
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,816
Now, listen carefully.

1072
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:16,702
In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1073
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:20,166
Now, repeat that after me.

1074
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:23,875
In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire
hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1075
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:27,087
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,

1076
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:29,009
hurricanes hardly ever happen."

1077
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:30,377
Oh, no, no, no.

1078
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,554
Have you no ear at all?

1079
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:35,473
- Should I do it over?
- No, please.

1080
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,432
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

1081
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:42,523
Go: Ha, ha, ha.

1082
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:46,648
Ha, ha, ha.

1083
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,569
Go on, go on, go on.

1084
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,950
Ha, ha, ha.

1085
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,118
Does the same thing hold true
in India, Pickering?

1086
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:58,367
Is it truly a habit to them,
their dropping a letter like the letter H,

1087
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:02,210
using it where it doesn't belong,
like "hever" instead of "ever"?

1088
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,207
Why is it that Slavs,
when they learn English,

1089
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,959
have a tendency to do it with G's?

1090
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:08,803
- They say "linger" instead of "linger."
ELIZA: Ha, ha, ha.

1091
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,337
And then they turn right around
and say "singer" instead of "singer."

1092
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:15,512
I've noticed the Slavs using it
where it isn't needed,

1093
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:18,432
they learn English,
they have to do it with their G's.

1094
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,074
The girl, Higgins.

1095
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,025
Go on, go on, go on.

1096
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:31,316
- Go on.
- Ha, ha, ha.

All day long

1103
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,224
On his feet

1104
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:57,637
Up and down until he's numb

1105
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:59,888
Doesn't rest

1106
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,060
Doesn't eat

1107
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:06,359
Doesn't touch a crumb

1108
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:10,441
Again, Eliza.

1109
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:14,412
How kind of you to let me come.

1110
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,414
How kind of you to let me come.

1111
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,617
No, kind of you. Kind of you.

1112
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:23,578
Kind.
How kind of you to let me come.

1113
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,670
- How kind of you to let me come.
- No, no.

1114
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:29,877
Kind of you. Kind of you.
It's like "cup of tea," kind of you.

1115
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,378
Cup of tea. Say "cup of tea."

1116
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:33,921
- Cup of tea.
- No, no.

1117
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,474
A cup of tea.

1118
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:40,138
It's awfully good cake, this.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

1119
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:41,472
Mm. First rate.

1120
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,353
And those strawberry tarts
are delicious.

1121
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,980
Did you try the plain cake?

1122
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:51,939
Try it again.

1123
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:55,032
- Did you try the--?
- Pickering!

1124
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:56,859
Again, Eliza.

1125
01:07:57,074 --> 01:07:58,244
Cup of tea.

1126
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,830
Oh, no.

1127
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:01,325
Can't you hear the difference?

1128
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,496
Look, put your tongue forward

1129
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,665
until it squeezes on the top
of your lower teeth.

1130
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:10,375
- And then say "cup."
- Cup.

1131
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,047
- Then say "of."
- Of.

1132
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,795
Then say, "cup, cup, cup, of, of, of."

1133
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,298
- Cup, cup, cup, of, of, of.
- Cup, cup, cup, of, of, of.

1134
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:18,591
Cup, cup-- Of, of--

1135

PICKERING: By Jove, Higgins,
that was a glorious tea.

1136

Why don't you finish
that last strawberry tart?

1137
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:25,847
- I couldn't eat another thing.
- Oh, I couldn't touch it.

1138
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:28,063
- Shame to waste it.
- Oh, it won't be wasted.

1139
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:32,691
I know somebody who's immensely
fond of strawberry tarts.

1140
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,162

Five.

1154
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,985
Six marbles.

1155
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,947
Now, I want you to read this
and I want you to enunciate every word

1156
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:30,794
just as if the marbles
were not in your mouth.

1157
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:36,381
With blackest moss the flower-pots
Were thickly crusted, one and all

Each word clear as a bell.

1159
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:44,681
With blackest moss the flower-pots...

01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,640
I can't. I can't.

PICKERING: I say, Higgins,
are those pebbles really necessary?

1162
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,734
If they were necessary

1163
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,519
they are necessary
for Eliza Doolittle.

I can't understand a word,
not a word.

poem is a little too difficult for the girl.

like "The Owl and the Pussycat?"

What's the matter?

01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,435
I swallowed one.

Oh, it doesn't matter, I got plenty more.
Open your mouth.

Quit, Professor Higgins

1180
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,499
Hear our plea

1181
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:56,214
Or payday we will quit
Professor Higgins

1182
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,549
"A" not "I"

1183
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,835
"O" not "ow"

1184
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:05,339
Pounding, pounding in our brain

1185
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,553
"A" not "I"

1186
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:10,274
"O" not "ow"

1187
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:13,265
Don't say "rine," say "rain"

1188
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,323
The rain in Spain

1189
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:23,856
stays mainly in the plain.

1190
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:27,702
I can't. I'm so tired.

1191
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,539
I'm so tired.

1192
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:34,155
For God's sake, Higgins,
it must be 3:00 in the morning.

1193
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:36,294
Do be reasonable.

1194
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:39,751
I am always reasonable.

1195
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:42,094
Eliza,

1196
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:46,429
if I can go on
with a blistering headache, you can.

1197
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,966
I got a headache too.

1198
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,350
Oh, here.

1199
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,560
I know your head aches.
I know you're tired.

1200
01:11:55,770 --> 01:12:00,650
I know your nerves are as raw
as meat in a butcher's window.

1201
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:05,783
But think what you're trying
to accomplish.

1202
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:09,989
Just think what you're dealing with.

1203
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:13,405
The majesty and grandeur
of the English language,

1204
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:16,711
it's the greatest possession we have.

1205
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:20,126
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed
through the hearts of men

1206
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:23,837
are contained
in its extraordinary, imaginative

1207
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:28,219
and musical mixtures of sounds.

1208
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:32,888
And that's what you've set yourself out
to conquer, Eliza.

1209
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:37,693
And conquer it you will.

1210
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,550
Now, try it again.

1211
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:11,184
The rain in Spain

1212
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:17,058
stays mainly in the plain.

1213
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,484
What was that?

1214
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:28,316
The rain in Spain

1215
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:33,780
stays mainly in the plain.

1216
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,790
Again.

1217
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:47,458
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

1218
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,054
I think she's got it.

1219
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:50,549
I think she's got it.

1220
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,760
The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1221
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:58,644
By George, she's got it
By George, she's got it

1222
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:02,312
Now once again
Where does it rain?

1223
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:03,772
On the plain

1224
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:05,362
On the plain

1225
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:08,487
And where's that soggy plain?

1226
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:09,985
In Spain

1227
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,696
In Spain

1228
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:16,406
ALL : The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1229
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,039
Bravo!

1230
01:14:18,246 --> 01:14:23,876
The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1231
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:28,009
In Hartford, Hereford
And Hampshire

1232
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:31,304
Hurricanes hardly happen

1233
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,925
How kind of you to let me come

1234
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:40,230
Now, once again
Where does it rain?

1235
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:41,725
On the plain

1236
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,516
On the plain

1237
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:46,610
And where's that blasted plain?

1238
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,106
In Spain

1239
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,608
In Spain

1240
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:54,239
The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1241
01:14:56,242 --> 01:15:00,662
The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1242
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:06,082
Pickering. Pickering. Olé. Olé.

1243
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:11,553
Olé!

1244
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,477
Hey, Pickering.

1245
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,612
HIGGINS:
Ho! Hey!

1246
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:40,740
ALL:
Olé!

1247
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:43,996
PICKERING:
Oh, dear.

1248
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:47,037
Oh, dear.

1249
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:48,792
We're making
fine progress, Pickering.

1250
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,593
I think the time has come
to try her out.

1251
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:55,008
- Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?
- Yes, I'm feeling fine, Mrs. Pearce.

1252
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,928
- How are you?
- Very well, sir, thank you.

1253
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,556
Let's test her in public
and see how she fares.

1254
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:03,484
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding.

1255
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:05,095
Do you know
what it might have been?

1256
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,771
Pounding?
I didn't hear any pounding.

1257
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,610
- You do, Pickering?
- No.

1258
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:11,435
You know, if this goes on,
Mrs. Pearce, you'd better see a doctor.

1259
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,691
- I know. We'll take her to the races.
PICKERING: The races?

1260
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:17,613
- My mother's box at Ascot.
- You'll consult your mother first?

1261
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:19,454
Oh, yes, of course.

1262
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:24,785
No, I think I should better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

1263
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:27,708
First thing in the morning,
we'll go out and we'll buy her a dress.

1264
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,587
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1265
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:31,844
PEARCE: But, Mr. Higgins,
it's early in the morning.

1266
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:34,916
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

1267
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:38,343
- Where does one buy a lady's gown?
- Whitley's, of course.

1268
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:41,103
- How do you know that?
- Common knowledge.

1269
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:42,886
Let's not buy her
anything too flowery.

1270
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:47,599
I despise those gowns with
sort of weeds here and weeds there.

1271
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:50,812
I wanna buy something
sort of simple and modest and elegant,

1272
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:52,524
is what's called for.

1273
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:56,034
Perhaps with a bow.

1274
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:57,989
Yes, I think that's just right.

1275
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,533
You've all been working
much too hard.

1276
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:04,704
I think the strain
is beginning to show.

1277
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:07,002
Eliza, I don't care
what Mr. Higgins says,

1278
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,706
you must put down your books
and go to bed.

1279
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,747
Bed, bed
I couldn't go to bed

1280
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,632
My head's too light
To try to set it down

1281
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:22,852
Sleep, sleep
I couldn't sleep tonight

1282
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:28,726
Not for all the jewels in the crown

1283
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:32,113
I could have danced all night

1284
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:35,395
I could have danced all night

1285
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:41,620
And still have begged for more

1286
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:45,124
I could have spread my wings

1287
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:48,158
And done a thousand things

1288
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:52,883
I've never done before

1289
01:17:54,587 --> 01:18:01,007
I'll never know
What made it so exciting

1290
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:07,219
Why all at once
My heart took flight

1291
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:12,603
I only know when he

1292
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:16,322
Began to dance with me

1293
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:21,236
I could have danced
Danced, danced

1294
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:25,237
All night

1295
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:39,128
SERVANT 1 :
It's after 3 now

1296
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,470
SERVANT 2 :
Don't you agree now

1297
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:45,546
- She ought to be in bed
- She ought to be in bed

1298
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,466
ELIZA: I could have danced
- You're tired out

1299
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:49,981
ELIZA: All night
- You must be dead

1300
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:51,813
- I could have danced
- Your face is drawn

1301
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:53,229
- All night
- Your eyes are red

1302
01:18:53,438 --> 01:18:55,608
- And still have
- Now say good night, please

1303
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:57,605
- Begged for more
- Turn out the light, please

1304
01:18:57,817 --> 01:18:59,527
It's really time for you to be in bed

1305
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:01,446
- I could have spread
- Do come along

1306
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:02,782
- My wings
- Do as you're told

1307
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:06,159
- And done a thousand things
- Or Mrs. Pearce is apt to scold

1308
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:08,327
- I've never
- You're up too late, miss

1309
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:10,246
- Done before
- And sure as fate, miss

1310
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:12,405
You'll catch a cold

1311
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:19,303
I'll never know
What made it so exciting

1312
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:25,715
Why all at once
My heart took flight

1313
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:29,808
- I only know
- Put down your book

1314
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,346
- When he
- The work will keep

1315
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:33,349
- Began to dance
- Now settle down

1316
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:34,691
- With me
- And go to sleep

1317
01:19:34,896 --> 01:19:40,106
I could have danced
Danced, danced

1318
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:42,488
All night

1319
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,775
I understand, dear

1320
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:47,029
It's all been grand, dear

1321
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:51,371
But now it's time to sleep

1322
01:19:57,502 --> 01:20:00,752
I could have danced all night

1323
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:04,173
I could have danced all night

1324
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:10,813
And still have begged for more

1325
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:14,265
I could have spread my wings

1326
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:17,807
And done a thousand things

1327
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:24,362
I've never done before

1328
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:30,950
I'll never know
What made it so exciting

1329
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:37,080
Why all at once
My heart took flight

1330
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:42,421
I only know when he

1331
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:45,720
Began to dance with me

1332
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:50,965
I could have danced
Danced, danced

1333
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:57,440
All night

1334
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:40,401
ALL : Every duke and earl
And peer is here

1335
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:44,475
Everyone who should be here
Is here

1336
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:48,402
What a smashing
Positively dashing spectacle

1337
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:52,413
The Ascot opening day

1338
01:21:52,617 --> 01:21:55,577
At the gate are all the horses

1339
01:21:55,786 --> 01:22:00,286
Waiting for the cue to fly away

1340
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:03,379
What a gripping, absolutely ripping

1341
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:08,256
Moment at the Ascot opening day

1342
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:12,256
Pulses rushing

1343
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:15,970
Faces flushing

1344
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:20,062
Heartbeats speed up

1345
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:24,149
I have never been so keyed up

1346
01:22:24,357 --> 01:22:26,017
Any second now

1347
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:27,983
They'll begin to run

1348
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:29,694
Hark, a bell is ringing

1349
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:32,824
They are springing forward
Look!

1350
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:36,532
It has begun

1351
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:05,612
What a frenzied moment that was

1352
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:10,105
Didn't they maintain
An exhausting pace?

1353
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,659
'Twas a thrilling, absolutely chilling

1354
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:17,954
Running of the Ascot opening race

1355
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,492
WOMAN 1:
Oh, no. No, it's true.

1356
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:39,158
- This is the time.
MAN: Yeah.

1357
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:40,946
WOMAN 2:
Yes.

1358
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,830
- Yes.
WOMAN 3: My daughter's...

1359
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:44,497
WOMAN 4:
They've had enough time.

1360
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:45,995
What did you think of the race?

1361
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:47,287
HIGGINS:
Mother.

1362
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:51,503
Henry. What a disagreeable surprise.

1363
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,302
Hello, Mother.

1364
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:55,376
- How nice you look.
- What are you doing here?

1365
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,881
You promised never to come to Ascot.
Go home at once.

1366
01:24:58,094 --> 01:25:00,644
- I can't, I'm here on business.
- No, Henry, you must.

1367
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,806
Now, I'm quite serious.
You offend all my friends.

1368
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,965
The moment they meet you,
I never see them again.

1369
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:06,734
Besides, you aren't dressed
for Ascot.

1370
01:25:06,936 --> 01:25:07,976
I changed my shirt.

1371
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:10,647
Now, listen, Mother,
I've got a job for you, a phonetics job.

1372
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,476
- I've picked up a girl.
- Henry.

1373
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:15,151
Oh, no, darling, not a love affair.
She's a flower girl.

1374
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:16,991
I'm taking her
to the annual Embassy Ball.

1375
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:19,406
- But I want to try her out first.
- I beg your pardon?

1376
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:22,405
- Well, you know the Embassy Ball.
- Of course, I know the ball, but--

1377
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,948
So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

1378
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:27,252
- Common flower girl?
- She'll be all right.

1379
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:28,866
I taught her how to speak properly.

1380
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:31,133
She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

1381
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:32,585
She is to keep to two subjects.

1382
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:35,705
The weather and everybody's health.
"Fine day" and "How do you do?"

1383
01:25:35,923 --> 01:25:37,723
Not to let herself go
on things in general.

1384
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:39,715
Help her along, darling.
You'll be quite safe.

1385
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:42,217
Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

1386
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,309
Well, she's got to talk
about something.

1387
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:46,675
- Where is the girl now?
- She's being pinned.

1388
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,942
Some of the clothes we bought her
didn't quite fit.

1389
01:25:49,145 --> 01:25:51,095
I told Pickering
we should have taken her with us.

1390
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,773
EYNSFORD-HILL:
Thank goodness you're here.

1391
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:58,815
MRS. HIGGINS: Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

1392
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:00,359
You know my son, Henry.

1393
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:02,413
Oh, how do you do?

1394
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:04,866
- I've seen you somewhere before.
- I don't know.

1395
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,407
Oh, it doesn't matter.
You better sit down.

1396
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:13,169
- Lady Boxington.
- Where the devil can they be?

1397
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:14,957
- Lord Boxington.
- Ha!

1398
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,084
MRS. HIGGINS: Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

1399
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:51,369
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.

1400
01:26:51,582 --> 01:26:53,422
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1401
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:54,876
MRS. HIGGINS:
My dear, Miss Doolittle.

1402
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:57,625
How kind of you to let me come.

1403
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:00,048
MRS. HIGGINS:
Delighted, my dear.

1404
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:01,716
Lady Boxington.

1405
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:04,136
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1406
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:05,385
Lord Boxington.

1407
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:07,346
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1408
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,096
Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.

1409
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:11,518
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1410
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:14,102
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1411
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,727
How do you do?

1412
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:21,154
How do you do?

1413
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:22,742
Miss Doolittle.

1414
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:26,867
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

1415
01:27:35,376 --> 01:27:37,996
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

1416
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:40,552
I'm so sorry that you missed it.

1417
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,466
Will it rain, do you think?

1418
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:47,596
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

1419
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:54,311
But in Hartford, Hereford
and Hampshire,

1420
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,400
hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1421
01:27:58,148 --> 01:27:59,398
How awfully funny.

1422
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:02,818
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

1423
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,528
Smashing.

1424
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:07,568
Hasn't it suddenly turned chilly?

1425
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,913
I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

1426
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,790
They bring on so much influenza.

1427
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:15,957
And the whole of our family
is susceptible to it.

1428
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,876
My aunt died of influenza.

1429
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:20,746
So they said.

1430
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:25,303
But it's my belief
they done the old woman in.

1431
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:27,638
MRS. HIGGINS:
Done her in?

1432
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:29,635
Yes, Lord love you.

1433
01:28:29,847 --> 01:28:32,137
Why should she die of influenza

1434
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:36,189
when she come through diphtheria
right enough the year before?

1435
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:39,055
Fairly blue with it, she was.

1436
01:28:39,273 --> 01:28:41,153
They all thought she was dead.

1437
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:45,608
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

1438
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:52,199
Then she come to so sudden,

1439
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:54,501
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

1440
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,246
Dear me.

1441
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:01,792
Now, what call would a woman
with that strength in her

1442
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:04,514
have to die of influenza?

1443
01:29:04,715 --> 01:29:09,755
What become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

1444
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,643
Somebody pinched it.

1445
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:17,229
And what I say is,

1446
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:20,856
them that's pinched it done her in.

1447
01:29:21,065 --> 01:29:24,435
Done her in?
Done her in, did you say?

1448
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,491
Whatever does it mean?

1449
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,565
Oh, that's the new small talk.

1450
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:31,281
To do somebody in means
to kill them.

1451
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:35,122
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

1452
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:36,619
Do I not?

1453
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:42,130
Them she lived with would have
killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1454
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:45,046
But it can't have been right
for your father

1455
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,505
to pour spirits down her throat
like that.

1456
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,586
It might have killed her.

1457
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:51,052
Not her.

1458
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,891
Gin was mother's milk to her.

1459
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:57,428
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat,

1460
01:29:57,643 --> 01:29:59,443
he knew the good of it.

1461
01:29:59,645 --> 01:30:01,475
Do you mean that he drank?

1462
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:04,688
Drank, my word, something chronic.

1463
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:11,605
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1464
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:13,074
It's the new small talk.

1465
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:15,413
You do it so awfully well.

1466
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:19,749
Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

1467
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:21,997
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

1468
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:24,039
HIGGINS:
Oh, no.

1469
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:25,803
Not at all, my dear.

1470
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,264
Well, lots of mercy, anyhow.

1471
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,299
What I always say--

1472
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:34,300
I don't know whether there's time
before the next race to place a bet.

1473
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:36,723
- But come, my dear.
MRS. HIGGINS: I don't suppose so.

1474
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:38,272
I have a bet on Number 7.

1475
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,265
I should be so happy
if you would take it.

1476
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:42,847
You'll enjoy the race
ever so much more.

1477
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,153
That's very kind of you.

1478
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,976
- His name is Dover.
PICKERING: Come along, my dear.

1479
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:54,241
ALL : There they are again
Lining up to run

1480
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:57,990
Now they're holding steady
They are ready for it

1481
01:30:58,203 --> 01:31:03,213
Look, it has begun

1482
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:08,961
Come on.

1483
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:11,633
Come on, Dover. Come on.

1484
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:13,682
Come on, Dover.

1485
01:31:13,886 --> 01:31:15,546
Come on.

1486
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:20,847
Come on, Dover!

1487
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:23,269
Move your blooming ass!

1488
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:29,111
MAN: Don't upset yourself, my dear.
WOMAN: Please.

1489
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:31,566
Oh, my dear.

1490
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,500
You're not serious, Henry.

1491
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,841
You don't expect to take her
to the Embassy Ball?

1492
01:31:50,047 --> 01:31:51,507
Don't you think she's ready for it?

1493
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:54,005
Dear, Henry,
she's ready for a canal barge.

1494
01:31:54,218 --> 01:31:56,298
Well, her language may need
a little refining, but--

1495
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:57,552
Oh, really, Henry.

1496
01:31:57,763 --> 01:32:00,013
If you cannot see how impossible
this whole project is,

1497
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:01,974
then you must be absolutely potty
about her.

1498
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:05,314
I advise you to give it up and not put
yourself and this girl through more.

1499
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:08,271
Give it up? It's the most fascinating
venture I've ever undertaken.

1500
01:32:08,482 --> 01:32:11,572
Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

1501
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:15,147
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

1502
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:16,784
What?

1503
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:20,450
You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

1504
01:32:20,661 --> 01:32:22,331
Here's the car.

1505
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:32,689
FREDDY:
I say, sir...

1506
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,200
Good evening, sir.

1507
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:45,491
Dinner ready? I'm famished.

1508
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:46,834
Immediately, sir.

1509
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:49,709
PEARCE:
Good evening, Professor Higgins.

1510
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:11,515
When she mentioned
How her aunt bit off the spoon

1511
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:15,440
She completely done me in

1512
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:19,531
And my heart went on a journey
To the moon

1513
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:24,868
When she told about her father
And the gin

1514
01:34:25,077 --> 01:34:29,577
And I never saw
A more enchanting farce

1515
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:34,000
Than the moment when she shouted:
"Move your blooming--"

1516
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:37,375
- Yes, sir?
- Is Miss Doolittle in?

1517
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:40,339
- Whom shall I say is calling?
- Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1518
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,430
Oh, if she doesn't remember
who I am,

1519
01:34:42,636 --> 01:34:45,596
tell her I'm the chap
who was sniggering at her.

1520
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:46,846
Yes, sir.

1521
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:49,097
- And will you give her these?
- Yes, sir.

1522
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:50,479
Wouldn't you like to come in?

1523
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:52,354
They're having dinner,
but you may wait.

1524
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:55,822
No. No, thank you. I want to
drink in the street where she lives.

1525
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:58,074
Yes, sir.

1526
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:10,164
I have often walked
Down this street before

1527
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:15,792
But the pavement always stayed
Beneath my feet before

1528
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:21,422
All at once am I
Several stories high

1529
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:27,353
Knowing I'm on the street
Where you live

1530
01:35:27,556 --> 01:35:33,096
Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?

1531
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:38,821
Can you hear a lark
In any other part of town?

1532
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:44,605
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?

1533
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:50,493
No, it's just on the street
Where you live

1534
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:56,044
And, oh, the towering feeling

1535
01:35:56,251 --> 01:36:02,381
Just to know somehow you are near

1536
01:36:02,591 --> 01:36:07,391
The overpowering feeling

1537
01:36:07,596 --> 01:36:13,596
That any second
You may suddenly appear

1538
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:19,440
People stop and stare
They don't bother me

1539
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:25,359
For there's nowhere else on earth
That I would rather be

1540
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:28,572
Let the time go by

1541
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:34,834
I won't care if I can be here

1542
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:41,090
On the street where you live

1543
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:42,546
PEARCE:
Oh, sir.

1544
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:47,295
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1545
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:50,511
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't
want to see anyone ever again.

1546
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:53,892
- But why? She was unbelievable.
- So I've been told, sir.

1547
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,680
Is there any further message?

1548
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:57,944
Yes. Tell her that I'll wait.

1549
01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:00,516
Oh, but it might be days, sir,
even weeks.

1550
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:03,902
But don't you see?
I'll be happier here.

1551
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:17,712
People stop and stare
They don't bother me

1552
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:23,804
For there's nowhere else on earth
That I would rather be

1553
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:27,125
Let the time go by

1554
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:34,432
I won't care if I can be here

1555
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:42,481
On the street where you live

1556
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:50,447
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

1557
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:53,277
You realize what you've got
to teach this poor girl in six weeks?

1558
01:37:53,493 --> 01:37:54,873
Teach her to walk, talk,

1559
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:57,118
address a duke, a lord,
a bishop, an ambassador.

1560
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,290
It's absolutely impossible.

1561
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:02,839
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

1562
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:05,254
I know you're a stubborn man,
but so am I.

1563
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:07,133
This experiment is over.

1564
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:09,550
And nothing
short of an order from the king

1565
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:11,759
could force me to recant.

1566
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,550
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1567
01:38:13,763 --> 01:38:16,223
You understand, Higgins, it's over.

1568
01:38:16,433 --> 01:38:17,683
Higgins.

1569
01:38:17,893 --> 01:38:20,483
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the embassy tonight,

1570
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:23,147
if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment whatever,

1571
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:24,566
it'll be on your head alone.

1572
01:38:24,774 --> 01:38:25,864
Eliza can do anything.

1573
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,687
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

1574
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:29,653
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

1575
01:38:29,863 --> 01:38:33,373
There will be no horses
at the ball, Pickering.

1576
01:38:34,659 --> 01:38:36,659
PICKERING:
Think how agonizing it would be.

1577
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:39,620
Oh, if anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

1578
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:41,331
You could always
rejoin your regiment.

1579
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:43,171
This is no time for flippancy,
Higgins.

1580
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:45,336
The way you've driven the girl
the last six weeks

1581
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,665
has exceeded
all bounds of common decency.

1582
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:49,471
For God's sake,
stop pacing up and down.

1583
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:50,764
Can't you settle somewhere?

1584
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:52,587
Have some port.
It'll quieten your nerves.

1585
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:55,182
I'm not nervous.

1586
01:38:55,722 --> 01:38:58,392
- Where is it?
- On the piano.

1587
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:00,887
- The car is here, sir.
- Oh, good.

1588
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:02,272
- Tell Miss Doolittle.
- Yes.

1589
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:05,809
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed. I bet you
that damned gown doesn't fit.

1590
01:39:06,024 --> 01:39:08,234
I warned you
about these French designers.

1591
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,453
We should've gone to an English shop,
everyone would've been on our side.

1592
01:39:11,655 --> 01:39:13,655
- Have a glass of port?
- No, thank you.

1593
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:24,285
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

1594
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:26,920
Well, we shall see.

1595
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:29,088
Suppose she doesn't?

1596
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,546
I lose my bet.

1597
01:39:31,758 --> 01:39:33,798
Higgins, there's one thing
I can't stand about you,

1598
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,430
that's your
confounded complacency.

1599
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:37,507
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake,

1600
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:40,812
it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1601
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:46,147
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1602
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:49,396
Oh, rubbish, Pickering.
Of course she matters.

1603
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:51,899
What do you think
I've been doing all these months?

1604
01:39:52,112 --> 01:39:55,412
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being

1605
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,315
and change her
into a different human being

1606
01:39:57,534 --> 01:39:59,794
by creating a new speech for her?

1607
01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:01,245
It's filling up the deepest gap

1608
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:05,924
that separates class from class
and soul from soul.

1609
01:40:06,126 --> 01:40:09,086
No, she matters immensely.

1610
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,110
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1611
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:35,398
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1612
01:40:35,572 --> 01:40:38,202
Don't you think so, Higgins?

1613
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:43,950
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1614
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:20,235
BUTLER:
Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Deuvile.

1615
01:43:22,739 --> 01:43:26,949
Major General the right honorable
Sir James Clarence.

1616
01:43:27,994 --> 01:43:30,954
Marquis and Marquise of Glenning.

1617
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:35,790
Lady Suzanna De Longly.

1618
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:39,380
Sir Albert and Lady Derring.

1619
01:43:40,006 --> 01:43:43,296
Honorable Mr. Archibald
and Lady Catherine Herring.

1620
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:45,759
Maestro. Maestro.

1621
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:51,059
- Don't you remember me?
- No. Who the devil are you?

1622
01:43:51,267 --> 01:43:52,267
I'm your pupil.

1623
01:43:52,477 --> 01:43:54,387
Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

1624
01:43:54,604 --> 01:43:57,064
I'm Zoltan Karpathy,
that marvelous boy.

1625
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:58,483
Oh.

1626
01:43:58,691 --> 01:44:00,571
I made your name
famous throughout Europe.

1627
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:02,567
You teach me phonetics,
you cannot forget me.

1628
01:44:02,779 --> 01:44:04,529
Why don't you have your hair cut?

1629
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,319
I don't have
your imposing appearance,

1630
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:07,572
your figure, your brow.

1631
01:44:07,784 --> 01:44:09,744
If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

1632
01:44:09,953 --> 01:44:11,663
Where did you get
all these old coins?

1633
01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:13,791
These are decorations
for language.

1634
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:15,868
The queen of Transylvania
is here this evening.

1635
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:19,094
I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

1636
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:21,915
I speak 32 languages,
I know everyone in Europe.

1637
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:24,171
No impostor
can escape my detection.

1638
01:44:24,384 --> 01:44:26,934
Professor Karpathy.

1639
01:44:28,429 --> 01:44:30,599
The Greek ambassador.

1640
01:44:30,807 --> 01:44:31,927
Greek my foot.

1641
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:34,641
He pretends not to know any English,
but he cannot deceive me.

1642
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,812
He's the son
of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1643
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:39,983
He speaks English so villainously

1644
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:43,651
that he cannot utter a word
without betraying his origin.

1645
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:46,151
I help him pretend,
but I make him pay through the nose.

1646
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:47,414
I make them all pay.

1647
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:49,195
Excuse me, sir,
you are wanted upstairs.

1648
01:44:49,409 --> 01:44:52,039
- Her Excellency asked for you.
- Oh, excuse me.

1649
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:12,675
BUTLER:
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

1650
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,520
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

1651
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:24,148
Sir Guy and Lady Skot Ackland.

1652
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:46,054
The Count and Countess Demerau.

1653
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:48,797
The Viscount
and Viscountess Hillyard.

1654
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,850
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

1655
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:55,058
Lord and Lady Clanders.

1656
01:45:55,892 --> 01:45:58,692
Miss Eliza Doolittle,
Colonel Pickering.

1657
01:45:58,895 --> 01:46:02,515
Miss Eliza Doolittle,
Colonel Pickering.

1658
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:05,112
- Professor Higgins.
- Good evening, Miss Doolittle.

1659
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:06,358
Your Excellency.

1660
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:08,699
- Miss Doolittle.
- How do you do?

1661
01:46:08,905 --> 01:46:11,315
- Good evening, colonel.
- Good evening.

1662
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:12,662
- Oh, colonel.
- What?

1663
01:46:12,825 --> 01:46:15,445
LADY: What an enchanting young
lady you have with you this evening.

1664
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,200
PICKERING: Thank you.
- Well, who is she?

1665
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:21,632
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

1666
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:23,004
Professor Higgins.

1667
01:46:23,211 --> 01:46:27,511
Such a faraway look
as if she's always lived in a garden.

1668
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:30,875
So she has, a sort of garden.

1669
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:49,238
WOMAN 1:
Is that her son?

1670
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:53,906
WOMAN 2:
I don't believe in...

1671
01:46:54,117 --> 01:46:56,117
WOMAN 3:
I shall die.

1672
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:02,080
Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

1673
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:04,421
Sort of, you know,
sort of impostorologist.

1674
01:47:04,627 --> 01:47:06,207
I beg your pardon.

1675
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:08,551
The young lady
with Colonel Pickering.

1676
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:10,666
Find out who she is.

1677
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:12,133
With pleasure.

1678
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:14,803
The whole situation
is highly explosive.

1679
01:47:17,515 --> 01:47:20,175
WOMAN 1:
We heard on the best authority.

1680
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:23,150
Tell me, Zoltan, some more
about the Greek ambassador.

1681
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:26,734
Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

1682
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:29,611
Does he really come
from Yorkshire?

1683
01:47:38,161 --> 01:47:41,081
BUTLER: Her Majesty,
the queen of Transylvania

1684
01:47:41,289 --> 01:47:45,249
and his Royal Highness,
Prince Gregor.

1685
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:33,840
Charming. Quite charming.

1686
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,510
Miss Doolittle, ma'am.

1687
01:49:00,368 --> 01:49:02,158
MAN:
Such a charming girl.

1688
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:05,500
WOMAN 1: We'll know
when we hear her announced.

1689
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,956
WOMAN 2:
That's a beautiful ball gown.

1690
01:49:15,758 --> 01:49:17,798
WOMAN 3:
Is that her son?

1691
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:15,571
Miss Doolittle,
my son would like to dance with you.

1692
01:51:10,122 --> 01:51:11,872
Eliza?

1693
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:24,957
PICKERING:
Absolutely fantastic.

1694
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:28,589
HIGGINS:
A lot of tomfoolery.

1695
01:53:28,803 --> 01:53:30,853
PICKERING:
It was an immense achievement.

1696
01:53:31,055 --> 01:53:32,675
Well, Mr. Higgins?

1697
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:36,350
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce.
A total triumph.

1698
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:39,770
Higgins, you were superb.
Absolutely superb.

1699
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,690
Tell us the truth now, weren't
you a bit nervous once or twice?

1700
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:45,440
- Not for a second.
- Not during the whole evening?

1701
01:53:45,653 --> 01:53:47,113
I saw we were gonna win
hands down.

1702
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:49,531
I felt like a bear in a cage
with nothing to do.

1703
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,120
It was an immense achievement.

1704
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:54,235
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given it up two months ago.

1705
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:57,413
- Absolutely fantastic.
- A lot of tomfoolery.

1706
01:53:57,623 --> 01:53:59,423
Higgins, I salute you.

1707
01:53:59,625 --> 01:54:02,335
Oh, silly people don't know
their own silly business.

1708
01:54:02,545 --> 01:54:05,585
Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it

1709
01:54:05,798 --> 01:54:08,508
You said that you would do it
And indeed you did

1710
01:54:08,717 --> 01:54:11,587
I thought that you would rue it
I doubted you'd do it

1711
01:54:11,804 --> 01:54:14,724
But now I must admit it
That succeed you did

1712
01:54:14,932 --> 01:54:17,432
You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight

1713
01:54:17,643 --> 01:54:20,813
Oh, it was nothing
Really nothing

1714
01:54:21,021 --> 01:54:23,731
All alone you hurdled
Every obstacle in sight

1715
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:25,651
Now wait
Now wait

1716
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:30,360
Give credit where it's due
A lot of the glory goes to you

1717
01:54:30,573 --> 01:54:33,493
But you're the one who did it
Who did it, who did it

1718
01:54:33,701 --> 01:54:36,451
As sturdy as Gibraltar
Not a second did you falter

1719
01:54:36,662 --> 01:54:41,502
There's no doubt about it
You did it

1720
01:54:44,503 --> 01:54:48,723
I must have aged a year tonight
At times I thought I'd die of fright

1721
01:54:48,924 --> 01:54:51,974
Never was there a momentary lull

1722
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:56,723
Shortly after we came in
I saw at once we'd easily win

1723
01:54:56,932 --> 01:54:59,642
And after that, I found it deadly dull

1724
01:55:00,895 --> 01:55:03,345
PICKERING: You should have heard
The "oohs" and "ahs"

1725
01:55:03,564 --> 01:55:05,024
Everyone wondering who she was

1726
01:55:05,232 --> 01:55:08,572
You'd think they'd never seen
A lady before

1727
01:55:08,777 --> 01:55:13,867
And when the prince of Transylvania
Asked to meet her

1728
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:18,754
And gave his arm
To lead her to the floor

1729
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:22,249
I said to him
You did it, you did it, you did it

1730
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:25,498
They thought she was ecstatic
And so damned aristocratic

1731
01:55:25,711 --> 01:55:30,881
And they never knew that you did it

1732
01:55:33,427 --> 01:55:35,087
Thank goodness
for Zoltan Karpathy.

1733
01:55:35,304 --> 01:55:37,564
If it hadn't been for him,
I would've died of boredom.

1734
01:55:37,765 --> 01:55:40,215
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

1735
01:55:40,434 --> 01:55:43,194
Yes, he was there, all right,
and up to his old tricks.

1736
01:55:43,395 --> 01:55:45,855
That blackguard
Who uses the science of speech

1737
01:55:46,065 --> 01:55:48,855
More to blackmail and swindle
Than teach

1738
01:55:49,068 --> 01:55:51,688
He made it
The devilish business of his

1739
01:55:51,904 --> 01:55:54,824
To find out who this Miss Doolittle is

1740
01:55:55,991 --> 01:55:58,371
Every time we looked around
There he was

1741
01:55:58,577 --> 01:56:00,827
That hairy hound from Budapest

1742
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:04,213
Never leaving us alone

1743
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:06,996
Never have I ever known
A ruder pest

1744
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:10,958
Finally I decided it was foolish

1745
01:56:11,173 --> 01:56:13,843
Not to let him have
His chance with her

1746
01:56:15,177 --> 01:56:19,717
So I stepped aside
And let him dance with her

1747
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:26,440
Oozing charm from every pore
He oiled his way around the floor

1748
01:56:26,647 --> 01:56:31,067
Every trick that he could play
He used to strip her mask away

1749
01:56:31,276 --> 01:56:32,936
And when at last
The dance was done

1750
01:56:33,153 --> 01:56:36,113
He glowed as if he knew he'd won

1751
01:56:36,323 --> 01:56:39,743
And with a voice too eager
And a smile too broad

1752
01:56:39,952 --> 01:56:43,622
He announced to the hostess
That she was a fraud

1753
01:56:44,248 --> 01:56:45,328
No.

1754
01:56:51,088 --> 01:56:52,798
"Her English is too good," he said

1755
01:56:52,965 --> 01:56:56,335
That clearly indicates
That she is foreign

1756
01:56:57,594 --> 01:57:00,224
Whereas others are instructed
In their native language

1757
01:57:00,431 --> 01:57:02,141
English people aren't

1758
01:57:03,934 --> 01:57:05,274
And although she may have studied

1759
01:57:05,477 --> 01:57:08,767
With an expert dialectician
And grammarian

1760
01:57:10,691 --> 01:57:17,861
I can tell
That she was a born Hungarian

1761
01:57:19,575 --> 01:57:22,365
Not only Hungarian
But of royal blood

1762
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:25,413
She is a princess

1763
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:29,292
"Her blood," he said, "is bluer
Than the Danube is or ever was

1764
01:57:29,501 --> 01:57:32,421
Royalty is absolutely written
On her face

1765
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:35,549
She thought that I was taken in
But actually I never was

1766
01:57:35,758 --> 01:57:38,468
How could she deceive
Another member of her race?"

1767
01:57:39,261 --> 01:57:43,811
"I know each language on the map,"
Said he

1768
01:57:44,016 --> 01:57:47,806
"And she's Hungarian
As the first 'Hungarian Rhapsody"'

1769
01:57:49,521 --> 01:57:50,981
SERVANTS :
Bravo

1770
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:52,940
Bravo

1771
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:55,360
Bravo

1772
01:57:56,320 --> 01:58:00,360
Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1773
01:58:00,574 --> 01:58:04,084
For your glorious victory

1774
01:58:04,286 --> 01:58:08,246
Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1775
01:58:08,457 --> 01:58:12,457
You'll be mentioned in history

1776
01:58:12,669 --> 01:58:15,709
- This evening, sir, you did it
- Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1777
01:58:15,923 --> 01:58:18,633
- You said that you would do it
- For your glorious victory

1778
01:58:18,842 --> 01:58:21,552
This evening, sir, you did it
You did it, you did it

1779
01:58:21,762 --> 01:58:23,812
We know that we have did it
But you did it

1780
01:58:24,014 --> 01:58:32,364
And the credit for it
All belongs to you

1781
01:58:34,525 --> 01:58:37,145
Well, thank God that's over.

1782
01:58:37,361 --> 01:58:39,861
Now I can go to bed
without dreading tomorrow.

1783
01:58:42,366 --> 01:58:44,696
PEARCE: Good night, Mr. Higgins.
HIGGINS: Good night, Mrs. Pearce.

1784
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:47,200
PICKERING: I think I'll turn in too.
Good night, Higgins.

1785
01:58:47,412 --> 01:58:48,962
It's been a great occasion.

1786
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:50,794
Good night, Pickering.

1787
01:58:51,416 --> 01:58:53,496
Oh, Mrs. Pearce?

1788
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:55,090
Oh, damn.

1789
01:58:55,295 --> 01:58:58,255
I meant to ask her to give me coffee
in the morning instead of tea.

1790
01:58:58,465 --> 01:59:00,295
Leave a little note for her,
will you, Eliza?

1791
01:59:00,509 --> 01:59:02,469
And put out the lights.

1792
01:59:50,017 --> 01:59:52,887
HIGGINS:
Left them downstairs. Oh, darn it.

1793
01:59:53,103 --> 01:59:55,233
Leave my head behind
one of these days.

1794
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:57,819
What the devil have I done
with my slippers?

1795
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:02,780
Here are your slippers.

1796
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:04,700
There!

1797
02:00:05,115 --> 02:00:07,025
And there!

1798
02:00:07,242 --> 02:00:11,542
Take your slippers and may you never
have a day's luck with them.

1799
02:00:11,747 --> 02:00:15,117
What on earth?
What's the matter? Is anything wrong?

1800
02:00:15,626 --> 02:00:18,536
No, nothing wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?

1801
02:00:18,754 --> 02:00:21,514
That's enough for you.
I don't matter, I suppose.

1802
02:00:22,216 --> 02:00:25,086
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect.

1803
02:00:25,302 --> 02:00:27,642
I won it. What did you throw
those slippers at me for?

1804
02:00:27,846 --> 02:00:30,806
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute.

1805
02:00:31,016 --> 02:00:33,476
Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up in the gutter?

1806
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:36,725
You thank God it's all over now,
you can throw me back again there.

1807
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:39,899
Oh, so the creature's nervous
after all.

1808
02:00:43,403 --> 02:00:45,613
Claws in, you cat. How dare you
show your temper to me.

1809
02:00:45,822 --> 02:00:46,912
Sit down and be quiet.

1810
02:00:47,115 --> 02:00:52,325
Oh, what's to become of me?
What's to become of me?

1811
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,540
How do I know what's to become
of you? What does it matter?

1812
02:00:56,750 --> 02:01:00,500
You don't care. I know you don't care.
You wouldn't care if I was dead.

1813
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:03,882
I'm nothing to you.
Not as much as them slippers.

1814
02:01:04,091 --> 02:01:06,431
- Those slippers.
- Those slippers.

1815
02:01:06,635 --> 02:01:09,425
I didn't think
it meant any difference now.

1816
02:01:12,099 --> 02:01:14,979
Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

1817
02:01:15,185 --> 02:01:17,725
May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

1818
02:01:17,938 --> 02:01:18,978
No.

1819
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:21,939
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

1820
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:23,280
No.

1821
02:01:23,485 --> 02:01:27,145
Well, you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

1822
02:01:27,572 --> 02:01:31,202
- No.
- No. I'm glad to hear that.

1823
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:34,750
Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

1824
02:01:34,955 --> 02:01:37,535
Would you have a chocolate?

1825
02:01:37,749 --> 02:01:39,419
No!

1826
02:01:39,626 --> 02:01:40,706
Thank you.

1827
02:01:42,337 --> 02:01:44,667
Well, it's only natural
that you should be anxious,

1828
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:46,221
but it's all over now.

1829
02:01:46,425 --> 02:01:48,175
Nothing more to worry about.

1830
02:01:48,385 --> 02:01:52,215
No, nothing more for you
to worry about.

1831
02:01:52,597 --> 02:01:55,727
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1832
02:01:55,934 --> 02:01:59,194
Why? In heaven's name, why?

1833
02:01:59,396 --> 02:02:03,226
Now, listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

1834
02:02:03,442 --> 02:02:05,612
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1835
02:02:05,819 --> 02:02:09,199
It's just imagination.
Nothing's wrong. Nobody's hurting you.

1836
02:02:09,406 --> 02:02:12,776
Now, you go to bed and sleep it off.
Have a little cry and say your prayers

1837
02:02:12,993 --> 02:02:15,333
and you'll feel
very much more comfortable.

1838
02:02:15,537 --> 02:02:19,117
I heard your prayers,
"Thank God it's all over."

1839
02:02:19,333 --> 02:02:20,923
Well, don't you thank God
it's all over

1840
02:02:21,126 --> 02:02:23,416
and how you're free
and you can do what you like.

1841
02:02:23,628 --> 02:02:27,008
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

1842
02:02:27,466 --> 02:02:30,676
Where am I to go?
What am I to do?

1843
02:02:30,886 --> 02:02:33,846
And what's to become of me?

1844
02:02:34,056 --> 02:02:38,136
Oh, that's what's worrying you, is it?

1845
02:02:38,518 --> 02:02:40,308
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that
if I were you.

1846
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,980
I'm sure you won't have
any difficulty

1847
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:44,649
in settling yourself
somewhere or other.

1848
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:50,284
I didn't quite realize
you were going away.

1849
02:02:51,448 --> 02:02:53,528
You might marry, you know.

1850
02:02:53,742 --> 02:02:56,372
You see, Eliza, all men
are not confirmed old bachelors

1851
02:02:56,578 --> 02:02:57,658
like me and the colonel.

1852
02:02:57,871 --> 02:03:01,251
Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

1853
02:03:01,458 --> 02:03:02,538
And you're not bad-looking.

1854
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:05,171
You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

1855
02:03:05,379 --> 02:03:08,419
Well, not now. When you've been
crying you look like the very devil.

1856
02:03:08,632 --> 02:03:10,722
But I mean when you're all right
and quite yourself,

1857
02:03:10,926 --> 02:03:14,676
you're what I would call attractive.

1858
02:03:15,055 --> 02:03:16,845
Now, you go to bed,
have a good night's rest,

1859
02:03:17,057 --> 02:03:18,637
then get up
and have a look at yourself.

1860
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:21,060
You won't feel so bad.

1861
02:03:25,774 --> 02:03:29,404
I daresay my mother might find some
fellow or other who'd do very well.

1862
02:03:29,611 --> 02:03:31,651
We were above that
at Covent Garden.

1863
02:03:31,863 --> 02:03:33,283
What do you mean?

1864
02:03:33,490 --> 02:03:36,620
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1865
02:03:36,827 --> 02:03:40,117
Now, you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1866
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:42,540
Oh, tosh, Eliza,
don't insult human relations

1867
02:03:42,749 --> 02:03:45,749
by dragging all that cant about buying
and selling into it.

1868
02:03:45,961 --> 02:03:47,801
You don't have to marry
if you don't want to.

1869
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:51,474
- What else am I to do?
- Well, there are lots of things.

1870
02:03:51,675 --> 02:03:54,005
What about the old idea
of a florist shop?

1871
02:03:54,219 --> 02:03:57,139
Pickering would set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1872
02:03:57,347 --> 02:03:59,427
He paid for all those togs
you're wearing tonight.

1873
02:03:59,641 --> 02:04:03,481
And that with the hire of the jewelry
will make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1874
02:04:03,687 --> 02:04:06,187
Oh, come on now.
You'll be all right.

1875
02:04:07,190 --> 02:04:10,690
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

1876
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:13,736
I was looking for something.
What was it?

1877
02:04:13,947 --> 02:04:15,067
Your slippers.

1878
02:04:15,824 --> 02:04:19,494
Oh, yes, of course.
You shied them at me.

1879
02:04:19,703 --> 02:04:23,873
- Before you go, sir,
- Hm?

1880
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:28,919
do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

1881
02:04:30,046 --> 02:04:31,876
What the devil use
would they be to Pickering?

1882
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:33,800
Why do you bother about that
in the night?

1883
02:04:34,009 --> 02:04:35,759
I want to know
what I may take away with me.

1884
02:04:35,969 --> 02:04:37,849
I don't wanna be
accused of stealing.

1885
02:04:38,805 --> 02:04:40,925
Stealing?

1886
02:04:41,141 --> 02:04:44,231
You shouldn't have said that, Eliza.
That shows a want of feeling.

1887
02:04:44,436 --> 02:04:48,436
I'm sorry. I'm a common ignorant girl.
In my station, I have to be careful.

1888
02:04:48,648 --> 02:04:51,648
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

1889
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:54,860
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1890
02:04:56,031 --> 02:04:58,451
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

1891
02:04:58,658 --> 02:05:00,988
Except the jewelry, that's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

1892
02:05:01,203 --> 02:05:02,453
Stop, please.

1893
02:05:04,915 --> 02:05:08,455
Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

1894
02:05:08,668 --> 02:05:11,048
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

1895
02:05:13,173 --> 02:05:14,553
Hand them over.

1896
02:05:14,758 --> 02:05:16,548
If these belonged to me
and not the jeweler,

1897
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:19,470
I'd ram them
down your ungrateful throat.

1898
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:24,809
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1899
02:05:25,018 --> 02:05:27,188
I don't want it now.

1900
02:05:29,856 --> 02:05:31,766
Don't you hit me!

1901
02:05:31,983 --> 02:05:35,113
Hit you? You infamous creature,
how dare you suggest such a thing.

1902
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:37,950
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

1903
02:05:38,156 --> 02:05:42,236
I'm glad.
I've got a little of my own back anyhow.

1904
02:05:42,911 --> 02:05:44,291
You've caused me
to lose my temper,

1905
02:05:44,496 --> 02:05:46,286
a thing that's hardly
happened to me before.

1906
02:05:46,498 --> 02:05:48,998
I don't wish to discuss it
further tonight. I'm going to bed.

1907
02:05:49,209 --> 02:05:51,839
You better leave your own note
for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee

1908
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:53,585
for it won't be done by me.

1909
02:05:53,797 --> 02:05:58,377
Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you.

1910
02:05:58,593 --> 02:06:00,223
And damn my own folly
for having lavished

1911
02:06:00,428 --> 02:06:03,058
my hard-earned knowledge
and the treasure of my regard

1912
02:06:03,265 --> 02:06:07,095
and intimacy
on a heartless guttersnipe.

1913
02:06:57,235 --> 02:07:02,355
Just you wait, Henry Higgins
Just you wait

1914
02:07:03,825 --> 02:07:08,285
You'll be sorry
But your tears'll be too late

1915
02:07:10,081 --> 02:07:13,131
You will be the one it's done to

1916
02:07:13,752 --> 02:07:17,252
And you'll have no one to run to

1917
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:19,512
Just you wait

1918
02:07:47,786 --> 02:07:53,076
I have often walked
Down this street before

1919
02:07:53,583 --> 02:07:58,923
But the pavement always stayed
Beneath my feet before

1920
02:07:59,381 --> 02:08:05,011
All at once am I
Several stories high

1921
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:10,970
Knowing I'm on the street
Where you live

1922
02:08:11,184 --> 02:08:16,814
Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?

1923
02:08:17,023 --> 02:08:22,823
Can you hear a lark
In any other part of town?

1924
02:08:23,029 --> 02:08:28,619
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?

1925
02:08:28,827 --> 02:08:34,827
No, it's just on the street
Where you live

1926
02:08:35,041 --> 02:08:40,421
And, oh, the towering feeling

1927
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:46,550
Just to know somehow you are near

1928
02:08:47,178 --> 02:08:51,808
The overpowering feeling

1929
02:08:52,016 --> 02:08:58,186
That any second
You may suddenly appear

1930
02:08:58,398 --> 02:09:01,228
People stop and stare

1931
02:09:01,443 --> 02:09:03,193
They don't...

1932
02:09:08,408 --> 02:09:09,988
Darling.

1933
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:12,490
Freddy,
whatever are you doing here?

1934
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:14,754
Nothing.
I spend most of my nights here.

1935
02:09:14,956 --> 02:09:18,166
It's the only place where I'm happy.
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1936
02:09:18,376 --> 02:09:20,336
Don't you call me Miss Doolittle,
do you hear?

1937
02:09:20,545 --> 02:09:23,375
Eliza's good enough for me.

1938
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:27,970
Oh, Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1939
02:09:28,178 --> 02:09:31,218
Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

1940
02:09:31,431 --> 02:09:34,311
I've written two or three times a day
telling you. Sheet and sheets.

1941
02:09:34,809 --> 02:09:38,349
Speak
And the world is full of singing

1942
02:09:38,563 --> 02:09:43,653
And I am winging
Higher than the birds

1943
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:47,610
Touch
And my heart begins to crumble

1944
02:09:47,822 --> 02:09:51,582
The heavens tumble
Darling, and I'm--

1945
02:09:51,785 --> 02:09:54,745
Words, words, words
I'm so sick of words

1946
02:09:54,954 --> 02:09:57,964
I get words all day through
First from him, now from you

1947
02:09:58,166 --> 02:10:02,706
Is that all you blighters can do?

1948
02:10:02,921 --> 02:10:06,131
Don't talk of stars burning above

1949
02:10:06,341 --> 02:10:09,431
If you're in love, show me

1950
02:10:09,636 --> 02:10:11,426
Tell me no dreams

1951
02:10:11,638 --> 02:10:12,848
Filled with desire

1952
02:10:13,056 --> 02:10:15,766
If you're on fire, show me

1953
02:10:15,975 --> 02:10:18,515
Here we are together
In the middle of the night

1954
02:10:18,728 --> 02:10:22,558
Don't talk of spring
Just hold me tight

1955
02:10:22,774 --> 02:10:24,784
Anyone who's ever been in love
Will tell you that

1956
02:10:25,235 --> 02:10:27,985
This is no time for a chat

1957
02:10:29,447 --> 02:10:32,567
Haven't your lips
Longed for my touch?

1958
02:10:32,784 --> 02:10:37,624
Don't say how much
Show me, show me

1959
02:10:37,831 --> 02:10:40,961
Don't talk of love
Lasting through time

1960
02:10:41,167 --> 02:10:44,337
Make me no undying vow

1961
02:10:44,546 --> 02:10:50,046
Show me now

1962
02:10:51,177 --> 02:10:54,217
Sing me no song
Read me no rhyme

1963
02:10:54,430 --> 02:10:58,100
Don't waste my time
Show me

1964
02:10:58,309 --> 02:11:01,139
Don't talk of June
Don't talk of fall

1965
02:11:01,354 --> 02:11:02,774
Don't talk at all

1966
02:11:02,981 --> 02:11:04,611
Show me

1967
02:11:04,816 --> 02:11:06,936
Never do I ever
Want to hear another word

1968
02:11:07,151 --> 02:11:11,201
There isn't one I haven't heard

1969
02:11:11,406 --> 02:11:13,696
Here we are together
In what ought to be a dream

1970
02:11:13,908 --> 02:11:17,948
Say one more word and I'll scream

1971
02:11:18,162 --> 02:11:21,462
Haven't your arms
Hungered for mine?

1972
02:11:21,666 --> 02:11:23,326
Please don't explain

1973
02:11:23,543 --> 02:11:24,673
Show me

1974
02:11:24,878 --> 02:11:26,208
Show me

1975
02:11:26,671 --> 02:11:29,841
Don't wait until
Wrinkles and lines

1976
02:11:30,049 --> 02:11:33,259
Pop out all over my brow

1977
02:11:33,469 --> 02:11:40,269
Show me now

1978
02:11:42,228 --> 02:11:44,018
- Eliza, where are you going?
- To the river.

1979
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:46,690
- What for?
- To make a hole in it.

1980
02:11:47,692 --> 02:11:50,192
Eliza, darling, what do you mean?

1981
02:11:59,412 --> 02:12:00,502
Taxi.

1982
02:12:00,705 --> 02:12:01,955
FREDDY:
Taxi.

1983
02:12:02,165 --> 02:12:03,205
But I've no money.

1984
02:12:03,416 --> 02:12:04,456
ELIZA:
I have.

1985
02:12:04,667 --> 02:12:07,627
FREDDY: Where are we going?
- Where I belong.

1986
02:12:21,476 --> 02:12:24,266
Darling, shall I come with you?

1987
02:12:50,213 --> 02:12:53,473
MAN :
With one enormous chair

1988
02:12:53,675 --> 02:12:59,095
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

1989
02:12:59,305 --> 02:13:03,975
CHORUS:
Lots of chocolate for me to eat

1990
02:13:04,185 --> 02:13:08,645
Lots of coal making lots of heat

1991
02:13:09,816 --> 02:13:13,316
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet

1992
02:13:13,528 --> 02:13:18,368
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

1993
02:13:19,075 --> 02:13:20,655
Oh, so...

1994
02:13:20,868 --> 02:13:23,538
Buy a flower, miss?

1995
02:13:23,746 --> 02:13:25,406
Yes, please.

1996
02:13:29,002 --> 02:13:32,962
CHORUS:
I would never budge

1997
02:13:33,172 --> 02:13:38,592
Till spring crept over me windowsill

1998
02:13:38,803 --> 02:13:43,143
Someone's head
Resting on my knee

1999
02:13:43,349 --> 02:13:47,889
Warm and tender as she can be

2000
02:13:48,104 --> 02:13:51,404
Who takes good care of me

2001
02:13:51,607 --> 02:14:00,277
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

2002
02:14:01,242 --> 02:14:05,162
Oh, good morning, miss.
Can I help you?

2003
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:09,540
Do you mind if I warm my hands?

2004
02:14:09,751 --> 02:14:11,881
Go right ahead, miss.

2005
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:20,590
- Yes?
- Oh, excuse me, miss.

2006
02:14:20,803 --> 02:14:22,643
For a second I thought
you were somebody else.

2007
02:14:22,847 --> 02:14:24,427
Who?

2008
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:25,680
Forgive me, ma'am.

2009
02:14:25,892 --> 02:14:28,022
Early morning light playing tricks
with my eyes.

2010
02:14:28,227 --> 02:14:29,517
Can I get you a taxi, ma'am?

2011
02:14:29,729 --> 02:14:31,349
A lady like you
shouldn't be walking alone

2012
02:14:31,564 --> 02:14:33,734
around London
this hour of the morning.

2013
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:37,359
No, thank you.

2014
02:14:46,245 --> 02:14:50,365
ELIZA : Someone's head
Resting on my knee

2015
02:14:50,583 --> 02:14:55,343
Warm and tender as he can be

2016
02:14:55,546 --> 02:14:58,626
Who takes good care of me

2017
02:14:58,841 --> 02:15:06,471
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

2018
02:15:06,682 --> 02:15:11,942
Loverly, loverly

2019
02:15:12,146 --> 02:15:18,936
Loverly, loverly

2020
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:20,533
MAN 1:
Goodbye, Alfie.

2021
02:15:20,738 --> 02:15:23,028
MAN 2: Goodbye.
MAN 3: I'll call you Mr. Doolittle now.

2022
02:15:23,241 --> 02:15:25,161
MAN 4:
Do come again, Mr. Doolittle.

2023
02:15:25,368 --> 02:15:27,658
We value your patronage always.

2024
02:15:27,870 --> 02:15:29,330
Oh, thank you, my good man.
Thank you.

2025
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:31,249
Here. Come here.

2026
02:15:31,457 --> 02:15:33,747
Take the missus on a trip to Brighton
with my compliments.

2027
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:36,630
MAN 4:
Thank you, Mr. Doolittle.

2028
02:15:37,421 --> 02:15:40,971
Charming spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.

2029
02:15:41,425 --> 02:15:42,625
Father?

2030
02:15:44,595 --> 02:15:46,135
Oh, no.

2031
02:15:46,347 --> 02:15:48,007
You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

2032
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:50,774
Sent her down to spy on me
in me misery, he did.

2033
02:15:50,977 --> 02:15:53,647
Me own flesh and blood.

2034
02:15:55,273 --> 02:15:58,283
Well, I'm miserable all right.
You can tell him that straight.

2035
02:15:58,484 --> 02:16:01,074
What are you talking about?
What you dressed up for?

2036
02:16:01,279 --> 02:16:02,529
As if you didn't know.

2037
02:16:02,738 --> 02:16:05,068
Go on back
to that Wimpole Street devil.

2038
02:16:05,283 --> 02:16:06,743
Tell him what he's done to me.

2039
02:16:06,951 --> 02:16:08,661
What's he done to you?

2040
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:10,120
Ruined me, that's all.

2041
02:16:10,329 --> 02:16:14,289
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

2042
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:15,830
And don't you defend him.

2043
02:16:16,043 --> 02:16:17,593
Was it him or was it not him

2044
02:16:17,795 --> 02:16:20,415
wrote to an old American blighter
named Wallingford

2045
02:16:20,631 --> 02:16:25,051
who was giving 5 millions
to fund moral reform societies

2046
02:16:25,261 --> 02:16:27,681
to tell him the most original moralist
in England

2047
02:16:27,889 --> 02:16:31,599
was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle,
a common dustman.

2048
02:16:33,102 --> 02:16:35,022
Sounds like one of his jokes.

2049
02:16:35,229 --> 02:16:38,479
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me proper.

2050
02:16:38,691 --> 02:16:41,691
The old bloke died and left me
4000 pounds a year

2051
02:16:41,903 --> 02:16:43,993
in his blooming will.

2052
02:16:44,405 --> 02:16:46,355
Who asked him
to make a gentleman out of me?

2053
02:16:46,574 --> 02:16:48,834
I was happy, I was free.

2054
02:16:49,035 --> 02:16:51,325
I touched pretty nigh everyone
for money when I wanted it,

2055
02:16:51,537 --> 02:16:53,157
same as I touched him.

2056
02:16:53,372 --> 02:16:57,462
Now I'm tied neck and heels
and everybody touches me.

2057
02:16:57,668 --> 02:17:01,128
A year ago,
I hadn't a relation in the world

2058
02:17:01,339 --> 02:17:03,259
except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

2059
02:17:03,466 --> 02:17:04,586
Now I've 50.

2060
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:07,550
Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

2061
02:17:07,762 --> 02:17:10,812
Oh, I have to live for others now,
not for myself.

2062
02:17:11,015 --> 02:17:12,925
Middle-class morality.

2063
02:17:13,142 --> 02:17:16,392
Come on, Alfie. Another couple
of hours, we have to be at the church.

2064
02:17:16,604 --> 02:17:19,484
- Church?
- Yeah, church.

2065
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:21,980
The deepest cut of all.

2066
02:17:22,193 --> 02:17:25,653
Well, why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

2067
02:17:25,863 --> 02:17:27,663
Your stepmother
wants to marry me.

2068
02:17:27,865 --> 02:17:30,775
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

2069
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:34,253
Well, if that's the way you feel about it,
why don't you give the money back?

2070
02:17:34,455 --> 02:17:36,575
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

2071
02:17:36,791 --> 02:17:41,461
It's easy to say chuck it,
but I haven't the nerve.

2072
02:17:41,671 --> 02:17:42,711
We're all intimidated.

2073
02:17:42,922 --> 02:17:45,222
That's what we are, intimidated.
Bought up.

2074
02:17:45,424 --> 02:17:47,594
Yeah. That's what I am.

2075
02:17:47,802 --> 02:17:50,512
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

2076
02:17:50,721 --> 02:17:53,101
Not my precious professor.

2077
02:17:53,307 --> 02:17:56,267
Oh, sent you back, has he?

2078
02:17:56,686 --> 02:17:59,266
First he shoves me
in the middle class,

2079
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:02,230
then he chucks you out
for me to support you.

2080
02:18:02,441 --> 02:18:04,731
That's all part of his plan.

2081
02:18:04,944 --> 02:18:07,364
But you double-cross him.

2082
02:18:07,571 --> 02:18:09,661
Don't you come back home to me.

2083
02:18:09,865 --> 02:18:12,075
Don't you take tuppence from me.

2084
02:18:12,285 --> 02:18:15,825
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, and you can do it.

2085
02:18:16,038 --> 02:18:19,368
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

2086
02:18:19,583 --> 02:18:21,503
Eliza, it's getting awfully cold
in that taxi.

2087
02:18:21,711 --> 02:18:25,761
Here, Eliza, would you like to come
and see me turned off this morning?

2088
02:18:25,965 --> 02:18:28,545
St. George's Hanover Square,
10:00.

2089
02:18:28,759 --> 02:18:30,509
I wouldn't advise it,
but you're welcome.

2090
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:33,220
- No, thank you, Dad.
- No.

2091
02:18:33,431 --> 02:18:35,971
Are you all finished here, Eliza?

2092
02:18:36,183 --> 02:18:37,813
Yes, Freddy.

2093
02:18:38,019 --> 02:18:40,189
I'm all finished here.

2094
02:18:43,065 --> 02:18:44,645
Good luck, Dad.

2095
02:18:44,859 --> 02:18:46,989
Thank you, Eliza.

2096
02:19:03,878 --> 02:19:06,958
- Come along, Alfie.
- How much time have I got left?

2097
02:19:07,173 --> 02:19:10,053
There's just a few more hours

2098
02:19:10,259 --> 02:19:12,509
That's all the time you've got

2099
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:17,890
A few more hours
Before they tie the knot

2100
02:19:18,642 --> 02:19:21,812
There's drinks and girls
All over London

2101
02:19:22,021 --> 02:19:26,321
And I gotta track 'em down
In just a few more hours

2102
02:19:26,525 --> 02:19:28,685
Set 'em up, me darlin'

2103
02:19:28,903 --> 02:19:32,863
I'm gettin' married in the mornin'

2104

The bells are gonna chime

2105

But get me to the church on time

02:19:58,224 --> 02:20:01,774
But get me to the church on time

2112
02:20:02,103 --> 02:20:05,863

- Pickering.
- What's the matter?

2184
02:25:13,622 --> 02:25:15,252
Here's a confounded thing.
Eliza's bolted.

2185
02:25:15,457 --> 02:25:16,497
- Bolted?
- Bolted.

2186
02:25:16,709 --> 02:25:18,839
Last night, Mrs. Pearce let her go
without telling me.

2187
02:25:19,044 --> 02:25:20,504
- Well, I'm dashed.
- What am I to do?

2188
02:25:20,713 --> 02:25:23,173
I got tea instead of coffee.
I don't know where anything is.

2189
02:25:23,382 --> 02:25:25,432
- I don't know my appointments.
- Eliza would know.

2190
02:25:25,634 --> 02:25:27,094
Of course she'd know,
but she's gone.

2191
02:25:27,302 --> 02:25:28,932
Did either of you
frighten her last night?

2192
02:25:29,138 --> 02:25:30,968
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.

2193
02:25:31,181 --> 02:25:32,641
Did you bully her
after I went to bed?

2194
02:25:32,850 --> 02:25:34,890
The other way around.
She threw the slippers at me.

2195
02:25:35,102 --> 02:25:36,812
I never gave her
the slightest provocation.

2196
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:39,440
The slippers came, bang, at my head
before I uttered a word.

2197
02:25:39,648 --> 02:25:41,608
Used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked.

2198
02:25:41,817 --> 02:25:43,437
- Well, I'm dashed.
- I don't understand.

2199
02:25:43,652 --> 02:25:45,152
We've given her every consideration.

2200
02:25:45,362 --> 02:25:47,162
- She admitted it herself.
- Well, I'm dashed.

2201
02:25:47,364 --> 02:25:49,994
Oh, Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something.

2202
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:51,490
- What?
- Well, phone the police.

2203
02:25:51,702 --> 02:25:53,332
What are they
there for in heaven's name?

2204
02:25:53,537 --> 02:25:55,657
Mr. Higgins, you can't give
Eliza's name to the police

2205
02:25:55,873 --> 02:25:57,873
as if she were a thief
or a lost umbrella.

2206
02:25:58,083 --> 02:25:59,833
But why not? I want to find the girl.

2207
02:26:00,043 --> 02:26:02,883
She belongs to me.
I paid 5 pounds for her.

2208
02:26:03,088 --> 02:26:05,878
Quite right. Hello.
Scotland Yard, please.

2209
02:26:06,091 --> 02:26:07,551
Get me some coffee,
would you please?

2210
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:08,970
- Yes, sir.
MAN: Who's there?

2211
02:26:09,178 --> 02:26:12,468
Scotland Yard? Yes, of course.
I beg your pardon, yes.

2212
02:26:12,681 --> 02:26:16,181
This is Colonel Pickering speaking.
Hugh Pickering.

2213
02:26:16,393 --> 02:26:19,603
- 27A Wimpole Street.
- 27A Wimpole Street.

2214
02:26:19,813 --> 02:26:22,523
- I want to report a missing person.
- Male or female?

2215
02:26:22,733 --> 02:26:26,193
A Miss Eliza Doolittle, yeah.
About 21.

2216
02:26:26,403 --> 02:26:28,453
And her height?

2217
02:26:28,655 --> 02:26:31,695
- I should say about 5'7".
- What color eyes?

2218
02:26:31,909 --> 02:26:35,999
Her eyes? Oh, let me think now.
Her eyes, her eyes.

2219
02:26:36,205 --> 02:26:38,785
- Brown.
- Brown, yeah.

2220
02:26:38,999 --> 02:26:41,879
No, no, no. Her hair?

2221
02:26:42,085 --> 02:26:43,285
Oh, good Lord. Let me...

2222
02:26:43,504 --> 02:26:45,214
Well, sort of nondescript
neutral sort of--

2223
02:26:45,422 --> 02:26:47,052
Brown, brown, brown.

2224
02:26:47,257 --> 02:26:49,757
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.

2225
02:26:49,968 --> 02:26:51,338
No, no, no, this is her residence.

2226
02:26:51,553 --> 02:26:53,553
27A-- Yeah.

2227
02:26:53,764 --> 02:26:56,774
About between 3 and 4 this morning,
I understand.

2228
02:26:56,975 --> 02:26:58,515
Yes. No, no, no.

2229
02:26:58,727 --> 02:27:00,517
Rela-- No, she's no relation, no.

2230
02:27:00,729 --> 02:27:04,729
What? Well, just let's call her
a good friend, shall we?

2231
02:27:04,942 --> 02:27:06,322
I beg your pardon?

2232
02:27:06,527 --> 02:27:09,317
Listen to me, my man,
I don't like the tenor of that question.

2233
02:27:09,530 --> 02:27:12,780
What the girl does here is our affair.

2234
02:27:12,991 --> 02:27:16,911
Your affair is to get her back
so that she can continue doing it.

2235
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,830
Well, I'm dashed.

2236
02:27:21,250 --> 02:27:24,090
What, in all in heaven,
Can have prompted her to go?

2237
02:27:24,294 --> 02:27:27,094
After such a triumph at the ball?

2238
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:29,877
What could have depressed her?
What could have possessed her?

2239
02:27:30,092 --> 02:27:33,642
I cannot understand
The wretch at all

2240
02:27:35,097 --> 02:27:37,887
Higgins, I have an old school chum
at the Home Office.

2241
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:41,270
Perhaps he can help.
Think I'll give him a ring.

2242
02:27:41,478 --> 02:27:43,018
WOMAN :
Number, please.

2243
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:45,400
Whitehall 72-double 4, please.

2244
02:27:45,607 --> 02:27:47,897
Whitehall 72-double 4.

2245
02:27:48,110 --> 02:27:50,610
Women are irrational
That's all there is to that

2246
02:27:50,821 --> 02:27:53,661
Their heads are full of cotton
Hay and rags

2247
02:27:53,866 --> 02:27:56,776
They're nothing but exasperating
Irritating, vacillating

2248
02:27:56,994 --> 02:28:01,004
Calculating, agitating, maddening
And infuriating hags

2249
02:28:01,206 --> 02:28:02,286
MAN:
The Home Office here.

2250
02:28:02,499 --> 02:28:05,039
Oh, I want to speak
to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.

2251
02:28:05,252 --> 02:28:08,672
- Would you hold on, sir?
- Brew-- Yes, I'll wait.

2252
02:28:13,135 --> 02:28:14,585
Pickering,

2253
02:28:14,803 --> 02:28:17,723
why can't a woman
be more like a man?

2254
02:28:17,931 --> 02:28:19,391
I beg your pardon?

2255
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:23,560
Yes, why can't a woman
Be more like a man?

2256
02:28:23,770 --> 02:28:26,690
Men are so honest
So thoroughly square

2257
02:28:26,899 --> 02:28:30,109
Eternally noble, historically fair

2258
02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:33,399
Who, when you win
Will always give your back a pat

2259
02:28:33,614 --> 02:28:36,994
Well, why can't a woman
Be like that?

2260
02:28:37,451 --> 02:28:40,661
Why does everyone
Do what the others do?

2261
02:28:40,871 --> 02:28:43,661
Can't a woman learn
To use her head?

2262
02:28:44,333 --> 02:28:46,963
Why do they do everything
Their mothers do?

2263
02:28:47,169 --> 02:28:50,459
Why don't they grow up
Well, like their father instead?

2264
02:28:50,672 --> 02:28:53,672
Why can't a woman
Take after a man?

2265
02:28:53,884 --> 02:28:57,014
Men are so pleasant
So easy to please

2266
02:28:57,220 --> 02:29:00,310
Whenever you're with them
You're always at ease

2267
02:29:00,515 --> 02:29:02,805
Would you be slighted
If I didn't speak for hours?

2268
02:29:03,018 --> 02:29:04,058
Of course not.

2269
02:29:04,269 --> 02:29:05,979
Would you be livid
If I had a drink or two?

2270
02:29:06,188 --> 02:29:07,228
Nonsense.

2271
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:09,399
Would you be wounded
If I never sent you flowers?

2272
02:29:09,608 --> 02:29:10,648
Never.

2273
02:29:10,859 --> 02:29:13,279
Well, why can't a woman
Be like you?

2274
02:29:14,321 --> 02:29:16,861
One man in a million
May shout a bit

2275
02:29:17,658 --> 02:29:20,368
Now and then
There's one with slight defects

2276
02:29:21,078 --> 02:29:23,408
One, perhaps, whose truthfulness
You doubt a bit

2277
02:29:23,622 --> 02:29:27,382
But by and large
We are a marvelous sex

2278
02:29:27,584 --> 02:29:30,544
Why can't a woman
Take after a man?

2279
02:29:30,754 --> 02:29:33,764
Because men are so friendly
Good-natured and kind

2280
02:29:33,966 --> 02:29:36,926
A better companion
You never will find

2281
02:29:37,469 --> 02:29:39,889
If I were hours late for dinner
Would you bellow?

2282
02:29:40,097 --> 02:29:41,137
Of course not.

2283
02:29:41,348 --> 02:29:43,308
If I forgot your silly birthday
Would you fuss?

2284
02:29:43,517 --> 02:29:44,557
Nonsense.

2285
02:29:44,768 --> 02:29:46,688
Would you complain
If I took out another fellow?

2286
02:29:46,895 --> 02:29:47,935
Never.

2287
02:29:48,146 --> 02:29:50,226
Well, why can't a woman
Be like us?

2288
02:29:52,901 --> 02:29:54,781
Oh, hello.
Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

2289
02:29:54,987 --> 02:29:57,357
- Yes, Budgin here.
- Bruzzie.

2290
02:29:57,572 --> 02:30:00,072
Oh, Bruzzie, you'll never
never guess who this is.

2291
02:30:00,283 --> 02:30:01,703
Oh, don't be silly. It's Pickering.

2292
02:30:01,910 --> 02:30:03,830
You're quite right, yes, it is.
Good heavens.

2293
02:30:04,037 --> 02:30:06,497
By George, what a memory.

2294
02:30:06,707 --> 02:30:08,207
How are you, Bruzzie?

2295
02:30:08,417 --> 02:30:10,327
Nice to hear your voice.

2296
02:30:10,544 --> 02:30:13,884
What? Oh, don't say that.
Is it already 30 years? Good heavens.

2297
02:30:14,089 --> 02:30:15,969
You're quite right.
Yes, oceans of water.

2298
02:30:16,174 --> 02:30:17,974
Listen, Bruzzie,
I'll tell you why I rang up.

2299
02:30:18,176 --> 02:30:21,426
Something rather unpleasant's
happened. Could I come and see you?

2300
02:30:21,638 --> 02:30:23,558
Well, I could.
Yes, now, straight away.

2301
02:30:23,765 --> 02:30:25,215
Right-o, good. Thank you, thank you.

2302
02:30:25,434 --> 02:30:27,694
Goodbye, Bruzzie.
Thank you very much.

2303
02:30:34,568 --> 02:30:37,858
Oh, Mrs. Pearce,
I'm going along to the Home Office.

2304
02:30:38,071 --> 02:30:40,281
Oh, I do hope you find her,
Colonel Pickering.

2305
02:30:40,490 --> 02:30:42,160
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

2306
02:30:42,367 --> 02:30:43,827
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?

2307
02:30:44,036 --> 02:30:47,246
Blast Mr. Higgins. I'll miss her.

2308
02:30:48,665 --> 02:30:50,205
HIGGINS:
Pickering?

2309
02:30:52,335 --> 02:30:54,125
Pickering?

2310
02:30:58,050 --> 02:30:59,430
Oh, Mrs. Pearce?

2311
02:30:59,634 --> 02:31:01,514
PEARCE: Yes, sir?
- Where's the colonel?

2312
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:03,300
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.

2313
02:31:04,473 --> 02:31:05,933
Oh, there you are.

2314
02:31:06,141 --> 02:31:11,271
I'm disturbed and he runs for help.
Now, there's a good fellow.

2315
02:31:11,646 --> 02:31:15,106
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.

2316
02:31:15,317 --> 02:31:18,817
Why can't a woman
Be more like a man?

2317
02:31:19,029 --> 02:31:22,069
Men are so decent
Such regular chaps

2318
02:31:22,282 --> 02:31:25,282
Ready to help you
Through any mishaps

2319
02:31:25,494 --> 02:31:28,504
Ready to buck you up
Whenever you are glum

2320
02:31:28,705 --> 02:31:31,825
Why can't a woman be a chum?

2321
02:31:32,667 --> 02:31:35,247
Why is thinking
Something women never do?

2322
02:31:36,046 --> 02:31:38,796
Why is logic never even tried?

2323
02:31:39,257 --> 02:31:42,087
Straightening up their hair
Is all they ever do

2324
02:31:42,302 --> 02:31:45,642
Why don't they straighten up
The mess that's inside?

2325
02:31:45,847 --> 02:31:48,637
Why can't a woman
Behave like a man?

2326
02:31:49,142 --> 02:31:52,192
If I was a woman
Who'd been to a ball

2327
02:31:52,395 --> 02:31:55,435
Been hailed as a princess
By one and by all

2328
02:31:55,649 --> 02:31:58,609
Would I start weeping
Like a bathtub overflowing?

2329
02:31:58,819 --> 02:32:01,739
Or carry on
As if my home were in a tree?

2330
02:32:01,947 --> 02:32:04,617
Would I run off
And never tell me where I'm going?

2331
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:08,700
Why can't a woman be like me?

2332
02:32:12,457 --> 02:32:14,077
Do you mean to say
that after you'd done

2333
02:32:14,292 --> 02:32:16,792
this wonderful thing for them
without making a single mistake,

2334
02:32:17,003 --> 02:32:18,963
they just sat there,
never said a word to you?

2335
02:32:19,172 --> 02:32:22,762
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

2336
02:32:22,968 --> 02:32:26,008
Not a word. They just sat there
congratulating each other

2337
02:32:26,221 --> 02:32:27,471
on how marvelous they'd been.

2338
02:32:27,681 --> 02:32:31,271
How glad they were it was all over
and what a bore it had all been.

2339
02:32:31,476 --> 02:32:32,686
This is simply appalling.

2340
02:32:32,894 --> 02:32:34,654
I should not have thrown
my slippers at him,

2341
02:32:34,855 --> 02:32:36,685
I should've thrown the fire irons.

2342
02:32:36,898 --> 02:32:38,268
HIGGINS: Oh, is mother in?
- What's that?

2343
02:32:38,483 --> 02:32:39,783
Henry.

2344
02:32:39,985 --> 02:32:42,525
I knew it wouldn't be too long.

2345
02:32:42,737 --> 02:32:44,697
Now, remember,

2346
02:32:44,906 --> 02:32:46,986
you not only danced
with a prince last night,

2347
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:50,040
you behaved like a princess.

2348
02:32:56,084 --> 02:32:59,174
Mother, the most confounded thing.
Do you...?

2349
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:03,510
You?

2350
02:33:04,134 --> 02:33:07,014
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2351
02:33:08,221 --> 02:33:09,811
- Am I--?
- Of course you are.

2352
02:33:10,015 --> 02:33:13,385
You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2353
02:33:13,602 --> 02:33:16,562
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

2354
02:33:16,771 --> 02:33:18,691
Now, get up and come home
and stop being a fool.

2355
02:33:18,899 --> 02:33:20,189
You've caused me enough trouble.

2356
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:22,030
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.

2357
02:33:22,235 --> 02:33:23,985
No woman could resist
such an invitation.

2358
02:33:24,196 --> 02:33:26,156
How did this baggage get here
in the first place?

2359
02:33:26,364 --> 02:33:28,994
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

2360
02:33:29,201 --> 02:33:31,741
And if you don't promise to behave,
I must ask you to leave.

2361
02:33:31,953 --> 02:33:33,873
You mean to say I'm to put on
my Sunday manners

2362
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:36,710
for this thing that I created
out of the squashed cabbage leaves

2363
02:33:36,917 --> 02:33:37,957
of Covent Garden?

2364
02:33:38,126 --> 02:33:39,286
That's precisely what I mean.

2365
02:33:39,502 --> 02:33:41,172
Well, I'll see her damned first.

2366
02:33:41,379 --> 02:33:44,299
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2367
02:33:44,507 --> 02:33:46,337
It was very difficult.

2368
02:33:46,551 --> 02:33:48,931
I should never have known
how ladies and gentlemen behave

2369
02:33:49,137 --> 02:33:51,847
if it hadn't been
for Colonel Pickering.

2370
02:33:53,141 --> 02:33:55,271
He always showed me
that he felt and thought about me

2371
02:33:55,477 --> 02:33:58,847
as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

2372
02:34:01,441 --> 02:34:05,241
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up,

2373
02:34:05,445 --> 02:34:07,315
the difference between a lady
and a flower girl

2374
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:10,370
is not how she behaves,
but how she is treated.

2375
02:34:13,787 --> 02:34:15,867
I shall always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins

2376
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:19,041
because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2377
02:34:20,460 --> 02:34:23,130
But I know I shall always be a lady
to Colonel Pickering

2378
02:34:23,338 --> 02:34:26,628
because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2379
02:34:31,012 --> 02:34:32,392
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2380
02:34:32,597 --> 02:34:35,217
The bishop is here, madam.
Shall I show him into the garden?

2381
02:34:35,433 --> 02:34:37,853
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no.

2382
02:34:38,061 --> 02:34:42,651
I should be excommunicated.
I'll see him in the library.

2383
02:34:42,857 --> 02:34:45,477
Eliza, if my son
starts breaking up things,

2384
02:34:45,694 --> 02:34:48,244
I give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2385
02:34:48,446 --> 02:34:51,316
Henry, dear, I suggest you stick
to two subjects:

2386
02:34:51,533 --> 02:34:53,873
The weather and your health.

2387
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:22,770
Well, you've had a bit
of your own back, as you call it.

2388
02:35:22,981 --> 02:35:25,111
Have you had enough
and are you going to be reasonable

2389
02:35:25,317 --> 02:35:26,357
or do you want any more?

2390
02:35:26,568 --> 02:35:28,358
You want me back
only to pick up your slippers

2391
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:31,160
and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2392
02:35:31,364 --> 02:35:33,494
- I didn't say I wanted you back at all.
- Oh, indeed?

2393
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:36,450
- Then what are we talking about?
- Well, about you, not about me.

2394
02:35:36,661 --> 02:35:39,291
If you come back, you'll be treated
as you've always been treated.

2395
02:35:39,497 --> 02:35:41,957
I can't change my nature.
I don't intend to change my manners.

2396
02:35:42,167 --> 02:35:44,377
My manners are exactly the same
as Colonel Pickering's.

2397
02:35:44,586 --> 02:35:45,626
That's not true.

2398
02:35:45,837 --> 02:35:48,207
He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2399
02:35:48,423 --> 02:35:50,513
Well, I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2400
02:35:50,717 --> 02:35:52,047
Oh, I see. The same to everybody.

2401
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:53,340
Just so.

2402
02:35:53,553 --> 02:35:56,263
You see, the great secret, Eliza,
is not a question of good manners

2403
02:35:56,473 --> 02:35:59,933
or bad manners
or any particular sort of manners,

2404
02:36:00,143 --> 02:36:05,233
but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2405
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:07,650
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely,

2406
02:36:07,859 --> 02:36:11,199
whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2407
02:36:11,404 --> 02:36:13,454
I don't care how you treat me.

2408
02:36:13,656 --> 02:36:15,066
I don't mind your swearing at me.

2409
02:36:15,283 --> 02:36:17,583
I shouldn't mind a black eye.
I've had one before this.

2410
02:36:17,786 --> 02:36:19,656
But I won't be passed over.

2411
02:36:19,871 --> 02:36:22,081
Well, then get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

2412
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:24,080
You talk about me
as though I was a motor bus.

2413
02:36:24,292 --> 02:36:25,332
So you are a motor bus.

2414
02:36:25,543 --> 02:36:28,383
All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2415
02:36:28,588 --> 02:36:31,338
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't.

2416
02:36:31,549 --> 02:36:34,339
I know you can. I told you you could.

2417
02:36:37,222 --> 02:36:42,102
You've never wondered, I suppose
whether I could get along without you.

2418
02:36:43,478 --> 02:36:45,598
Don't you try to get around me.

2419
02:36:45,814 --> 02:36:46,944
You'll have to.

2420
02:36:47,690 --> 02:36:51,070
So I can, without you
or any soul on earth.

2421
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:55,240
I shall miss you, Eliza.

2422
02:36:55,448 --> 02:36:58,158
I've learned something
from your idiotic notions.

2423
02:36:58,368 --> 02:37:01,408
I confess that, humbly and gratefully.

2424
02:37:03,915 --> 02:37:06,205
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2425
02:37:06,418 --> 02:37:08,748
When you feel lonely without me,
you can turn it on.

2426
02:37:08,962 --> 02:37:10,502
It has no feelings to hurt.

2427
02:37:12,424 --> 02:37:15,764
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

2428
02:37:17,929 --> 02:37:20,759
Ooh. You are a devil.

2429
02:37:20,974 --> 02:37:23,434
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily

2430
02:37:23,643 --> 02:37:25,983
as someone can twist her arms
to hurt her.

2431
02:37:26,187 --> 02:37:27,937
What am I to come back for?

2432
02:37:28,148 --> 02:37:30,318
For the fun of it.
That's why I took you on.

2433
02:37:30,525 --> 02:37:33,485
And you may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want me to.

2434
02:37:33,695 --> 02:37:36,735
Yes, and you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want me to.

2435
02:37:36,948 --> 02:37:37,988
And live with my father?

2436
02:37:38,199 --> 02:37:40,489
Yes, or sell flowers.
Or would you rather marry Pickering?

2437
02:37:40,702 --> 02:37:42,162
I wouldn't marry you
if you asked me,

2438
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:44,000
and you're nearer my age
than what he is.

2439
02:37:44,205 --> 02:37:45,905
- Than he is.
- I'll talk as I like.

2440
02:37:46,124 --> 02:37:47,674
You're not my teacher now.

2441
02:37:47,876 --> 02:37:50,626
That's not what I want,
and you don't think it is.

2442
02:37:50,837 --> 02:37:52,877
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2443
02:37:53,089 --> 02:37:55,169
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day.

2444
02:37:55,383 --> 02:37:56,843
Sheets and sheets.

2445
02:37:57,051 --> 02:37:59,511
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is.

2446
02:37:59,721 --> 02:38:01,641
- Is that it?
- No, I don't.

2447
02:38:01,848 --> 02:38:05,228
That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

2448
02:38:05,435 --> 02:38:07,595
I want a little kindness.

2449
02:38:07,812 --> 02:38:10,942
I know I'm a common ignorant girl
and you're a book-learned gentleman.

2450
02:38:11,149 --> 02:38:13,689
But I'm not dirt under your feet.

2451
02:38:13,902 --> 02:38:15,322
What I done--

2452
02:38:15,528 --> 02:38:19,068
What I did
was not for the taxis and the dresses,

2453
02:38:19,282 --> 02:38:22,532
but because we were
pleasant together and I've come to--

2454
02:38:22,744 --> 02:38:26,124
Came to care for you.

2455
02:38:26,331 --> 02:38:27,711
Not to want you to make love to me

2456
02:38:27,916 --> 02:38:29,706
and not forgetting
the difference between us,

2457
02:38:29,918 --> 02:38:33,418
but more friendly-like.

2458
02:38:35,048 --> 02:38:37,718
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

2459
02:38:37,926 --> 02:38:40,586
And how Pickering feels.

2460
02:38:40,803 --> 02:38:43,013
- Eliza, you're a fool.
- That's not the proper answer.

2461
02:38:43,223 --> 02:38:45,183
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2462
02:38:45,391 --> 02:38:47,351
If you're a lady,
give up feeling neglected

2463
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:49,440
if the men you know
don't spend half their time

2464
02:38:49,646 --> 02:38:52,106
sniveling over you and the other half
giving you black eyes.

2465
02:38:52,315 --> 02:38:54,725
You find me cold, unfeeling,
selfish, don't you?

2466
02:38:54,943 --> 02:38:56,823
Be off with you
to the sort of people you like.

2467
02:38:57,028 --> 02:38:58,818
Marry some sentimental hog
with lots of money

2468
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:02,070
and a thick pair of lips to kiss you
and a thick pair of boots to kick you.

2469
02:39:02,283 --> 02:39:05,293
If you can't appreciate what you've got,
get what you can appreciate.

2470
02:39:05,495 --> 02:39:06,655
Oh, I can't talk to you.

2471
02:39:06,871 --> 02:39:10,121
You always turn everything
against me. I'm always in the wrong.

2472
02:39:10,333 --> 02:39:12,463
But don't be too sure
that you have me under your feet

2473
02:39:12,669 --> 02:39:14,339
to be trampled on and talked down.

2474
02:39:14,546 --> 02:39:17,376
I'll marry, Freddy, I will,
soon as I'm able to support him.

2475
02:39:18,383 --> 02:39:19,843
Freddy?

2476
02:39:20,051 --> 02:39:22,261
That poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy

2477
02:39:22,470 --> 02:39:24,180
even if he had the guts to try for it?

2478
02:39:24,389 --> 02:39:28,059
Woman, don't you understand?
I've made you a consort for a king.

2479
02:39:28,268 --> 02:39:31,188
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2480
02:39:31,396 --> 02:39:34,266
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to it as I was.

2481
02:39:34,482 --> 02:39:36,072
I'll go and be a teacher.

2482
02:39:36,609 --> 02:39:38,149
What will you teach,
in heaven's name?

2483
02:39:38,653 --> 02:39:41,153
What you taught me.
I'll teach phonetics.

2484
02:39:42,198 --> 02:39:44,698
Ha, ha, ha.

2485
02:39:45,285 --> 02:39:50,035
I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2486
02:39:50,748 --> 02:39:54,588
What, that impostor? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2487
02:39:54,794 --> 02:39:56,804
Teach him my methods,
my discoveries?

2488
02:39:57,005 --> 02:39:59,965
You take one step in that direction
and I'll wring your neck.

2489
02:40:00,174 --> 02:40:04,514
Wring away. What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

2490
02:40:07,098 --> 02:40:09,308
That's done you, Henry Higgins,
it has.

2491
02:40:09,517 --> 02:40:13,597
Now, I don't care that
for your bullying and your big talk.

2492
02:40:13,813 --> 02:40:17,483
What a fool I was
What a dominated fool

2493
02:40:17,692 --> 02:40:20,902
To think you were the earth and sky

2494
02:40:21,112 --> 02:40:24,622
What a fool I was
What an elevated fool

2495
02:40:24,824 --> 02:40:28,584
What a mutton-headed dolt was I

2496
02:40:29,245 --> 02:40:32,905
No, my reverberating friend

2497
02:40:33,124 --> 02:40:37,754
You are not the beginning
And the end

2498
02:40:40,048 --> 02:40:41,628
You impudent hussy.

2499
02:40:41,841 --> 02:40:44,341
There's not an idea in your head
or a word in your mouth

2500
02:40:44,552 --> 02:40:46,052
that I haven't put there.

2501
02:40:47,722 --> 02:40:52,982
There'll be spring every year
Without you

2502
02:40:53,186 --> 02:40:56,806
England still will be here
Without you

2503
02:40:57,023 --> 02:41:00,613
There'll be fruit on the tree
And a shore by the sea

2504
02:41:00,818 --> 02:41:04,448
There'll be crumpets and tea
Without you

2505
02:41:04,656 --> 02:41:08,276
Art and music will thrive
Without you

2506
02:41:08,493 --> 02:41:12,043
Somehow Keats will survive
Without you

2507
02:41:12,246 --> 02:41:15,996
And there still will be rain
On that plain down in Spain

2508
02:41:16,209 --> 02:41:19,799
Even that will remain
Without you

2509
02:41:20,004 --> 02:41:23,724
I can do

2510
02:41:23,925 --> 02:41:25,425
Without you

2511
02:41:26,386 --> 02:41:28,966
You, dear friend

2512
02:41:29,180 --> 02:41:33,060
Who talk so well

2513
02:41:33,685 --> 02:41:40,515
You can go to
Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire

2514
02:41:40,733 --> 02:41:44,153
They can still rule the land
Without you

2515
02:41:44,362 --> 02:41:47,952
Windsor Castle will stand
Without you

2516
02:41:48,157 --> 02:41:49,867
And without much ado

2517
02:41:50,076 --> 02:41:52,946
We can all muddle through
Without you

2518
02:41:53,955 --> 02:41:55,955
You brazen hussy.

2519
02:41:56,457 --> 02:42:00,377
Without your pulling it
The tide comes in

2520
02:42:00,586 --> 02:42:04,546
Without your twirling it
The Earth can spin

2521
02:42:04,757 --> 02:42:09,797
Without your pushing them
The clouds roll by

2522
02:42:10,012 --> 02:42:15,232
If they can do without you
Ducky, so can I

2523
02:42:15,435 --> 02:42:18,935
I shall not feel alone
Without you

2524
02:42:19,147 --> 02:42:22,647
I can stand on my own
Without you

2525
02:42:22,859 --> 02:42:26,949
So go back in your shell
I can do bloody well

2526
02:42:27,155 --> 02:42:29,985
- Without--
By George, I really did it

2527
02:42:30,199 --> 02:42:31,239
I did it, I did it

2528
02:42:31,451 --> 02:42:33,871
I said I'd make a woman
And indeed I did

2529
02:42:34,078 --> 02:42:36,708
I knew that I could do it
I knew it, I knew it

2530
02:42:36,914 --> 02:42:39,624
I said I'd make a woman
And succeed I did

2531
02:42:39,834 --> 02:42:41,794
Eliza, you're magnificent.

2532
02:42:42,003 --> 02:42:44,423
Five minutes ago, you were a millstone
around my neck

2533
02:42:44,630 --> 02:42:46,510
and now you're a tower of strength.

2534
02:42:46,716 --> 02:42:49,506
A consort battleship.

2535
02:42:49,719 --> 02:42:51,549
I like you this way.

2536
02:42:53,556 --> 02:42:55,426
Goodbye, Professor Higgins.

2537
02:42:55,641 --> 02:42:58,311
You shall not be seeing me again.

2538
02:43:11,032 --> 02:43:13,332
Mother!

2539
02:43:13,534 --> 02:43:14,624
Mother!

2540
02:43:15,411 --> 02:43:17,501
What is it, Henry?
What's happened?

2541
02:43:19,248 --> 02:43:20,328
She's gone.

2542
02:43:20,541 --> 02:43:22,881
Well, of course, dear.
What did you expect?

2543
02:43:24,337 --> 02:43:25,797
Well...

2544
02:43:26,881 --> 02:43:29,341
- What am I to do?
- Do without, I suppose.

2545
02:43:31,427 --> 02:43:34,427
And so I shall.

2546
02:43:36,474 --> 02:43:39,484
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up
her little lungs,

2547
02:43:39,685 --> 02:43:42,845
let her seek some stuffiness
that suits her.

2548
02:43:43,064 --> 02:43:46,984
She's an owl sickened by a few days
of my sunshine.

2549
02:43:47,193 --> 02:43:48,993
Very well, let her go.
I can do without her.

2550
02:43:49,195 --> 02:43:51,395
I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul.

2551
02:43:51,614 --> 02:43:55,664
My own spark of divine fire.

2552
02:43:58,621 --> 02:44:00,911
Bravo, Eliza.

2553
02:44:20,476 --> 02:44:23,806
Damn, damn, damn, damn

2554
02:44:25,982 --> 02:44:28,022
I've grown accustomed to her face

2555
02:44:31,904 --> 02:44:33,994
She almost makes the day begin

2556
02:44:35,116 --> 02:44:38,326
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon

2557
02:44:38,536 --> 02:44:42,206
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs

2558
02:44:42,415 --> 02:44:44,325
Are second nature to me now

2559
02:44:45,585 --> 02:44:47,785
Like breathing out and breathing in

2560
02:44:48,921 --> 02:44:52,721
I was serenely independent
And content before we met

2561
02:44:52,925 --> 02:44:56,135
Surely I could always
Be that way again

2562
02:44:57,889 --> 02:45:01,889
And yet I've grown accustomed
To her look

2563
02:45:02,476 --> 02:45:04,306
Accustomed to her voice

2564
02:45:04,979 --> 02:45:09,399
Accustomed to her face

2565
02:45:23,581 --> 02:45:26,541
Marry Freddy.
What an infantile idea.

2566
02:45:26,751 --> 02:45:29,961
What a heartless, wicked,
brainless thing to do.

2567
02:45:30,171 --> 02:45:33,381
But she'll regret it. She'll regret it.

2568
02:45:33,591 --> 02:45:37,391
It's doomed before
they even take the vow.

2569
02:45:37,887 --> 02:45:41,557
I can see her now
Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill

2570
02:45:41,766 --> 02:45:44,306
In a wretched little flat
Above a store

2571
02:45:44,894 --> 02:45:47,654
I can see her now
Not a penny in the till

2572
02:45:47,855 --> 02:45:50,355
And a bill collector
Beating at the door

2573
02:45:50,983 --> 02:45:53,363
She'll try to teach the things
I taught her

2574
02:45:53,861 --> 02:45:56,201
And end up selling flowers instead

2575
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:59,164
Begging for her bread and water

2576
02:45:59,367 --> 02:46:02,697
While her husband
Has his breakfast in bed

2577
02:46:05,706 --> 02:46:09,956
In a year or so
When she's prematurely gray

2578
02:46:10,169 --> 02:46:13,709
And the blossom in her cheek
Has turned to chalk

2579
02:46:13,923 --> 02:46:15,473
She'll come home, and lo

2580
02:46:15,675 --> 02:46:17,125
He'll have upped and run away

2581
02:46:17,343 --> 02:46:20,103
With a social-climbing heiress
From New York

2582
02:46:20,304 --> 02:46:21,604
Poor Eliza

2583
02:46:21,806 --> 02:46:23,306
How simply frightful

2584
02:46:23,516 --> 02:46:25,556
How humiliating

2585
02:46:25,768 --> 02:46:27,518
How delightful

2586
02:46:30,064 --> 02:46:32,904
How poignant it'll be
On that inevitable night

2587
02:46:33,109 --> 02:46:35,939
When she hammers on my door
In tears and rags

2588
02:46:36,362 --> 02:46:39,612
Miserable and lonely
Repentant and contrite

2589
02:46:40,241 --> 02:46:42,741
Will I take her in
Or hurl her to the wolves?

2590
02:46:42,952 --> 02:46:45,952
Give her kindness
Or the treatment she deserves?

2591
02:46:46,163 --> 02:46:49,753
Will I take her back
Or throw the baggage out?

2592
02:46:52,420 --> 02:46:54,630
Well, I'm a most forgiving man

2593
02:46:55,131 --> 02:46:57,971
The sort who never could
Ever would

2594
02:46:58,175 --> 02:47:01,925
Take a position
And staunchly never budge

2595
02:47:04,765 --> 02:47:06,885
A most forgiving man

2596
02:47:09,812 --> 02:47:12,192
But I shall never take her back

2597
02:47:13,065 --> 02:47:14,975
If she were crawling on her knees

2598
02:47:15,818 --> 02:47:18,398
Let her promise to atone
Let her shiver, let her moan

2599
02:47:18,612 --> 02:47:22,702
I'll slam the door
And let the hellcat freeze

2600
02:47:25,369 --> 02:47:28,869
Marry Freddy. Ha!

2601
02:47:41,886 --> 02:47:47,216
But I'm so used to hear her say
Good morning every day

2602
02:47:47,433 --> 02:47:52,653
Her joys, her woes
Her highs, her lows

2603
02:47:52,855 --> 02:47:55,315
Are second nature to me now

2604
02:47:56,817 --> 02:47:59,317
Like breathing out and breathing in

2605
02:48:00,946 --> 02:48:02,856
I'm very grateful she's a woman

2606
02:48:03,074 --> 02:48:04,874
And so easy to forget

2607
02:48:05,534 --> 02:48:09,374
Rather like a habit
One can always break

2608
02:48:11,457 --> 02:48:16,587
And yet I've grown
Accustomed to the trace

2609
02:48:16,796 --> 02:48:19,706
Of something in the air

2610
02:48:20,716 --> 02:48:26,006
Accustomed to her face

2611
02:50:03,194 --> 02:50:04,864
ELIZA :
Oh, we are proud.

2612
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:08,200
He ain't above giving lessons, not him.
I heard him say so.

2613
02:50:08,407 --> 02:50:10,407
Well, I ain't come here
to ask for any compliment,

2614
02:50:10,618 --> 02:50:13,538
and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

2615
02:50:13,746 --> 02:50:14,946
HIGGINS:
Good enough for what?

2616
02:50:15,164 --> 02:50:16,624
ELIZA:
Good enough for you.

2617
02:50:16,832 --> 02:50:17,962
Now you know, don't you?

2618
02:50:18,167 --> 02:50:20,457
I'm come to have lessons,
I am, and to pay for them too,

2619
02:50:20,669 --> 02:50:21,709
make no mistake.

2620
02:50:21,921 --> 02:50:23,211
PICKERING:
What is it you want, my girl?

2621
02:50:23,422 --> 02:50:26,222
ELIZA:
I want to be a lady in a flower shop

2622
02:50:26,425 --> 02:50:29,385
instead of selling at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

2623
02:50:29,595 --> 02:50:32,555
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

2624
02:50:32,765 --> 02:50:34,595
He said he could teach me.

2625
02:50:34,808 --> 02:50:35,848
Well, here I am.

2626
02:50:36,060 --> 02:50:38,020
Ready to pay,
not asking any favor.

2627
02:50:38,229 --> 02:50:40,229
And he treats me as if I was dirt.

2628
02:50:40,439 --> 02:50:44,729
I know what lessons cost as well
as you do, and I'm ready to pay.

2629
02:50:44,944 --> 02:50:47,994
I won't give more than a schilling.
Take it or leave it.

2630
02:50:48,197 --> 02:50:52,527
HIGGINS: It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.

2631
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:54,870
So horribly dirty.

2632
02:50:55,079 --> 02:50:56,249
I'll take it.

2633
02:50:56,455 --> 02:50:59,865
I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

2634
02:51:01,585 --> 02:51:05,125
I washed my face and hands
before I come, I did.

2635
02:51:13,305 --> 02:51:15,055
Eliza?

2636
02:51:18,852 --> 02:51:20,562
Where the devil are my slippers?
